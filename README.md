## Core Principles

Suns0lver is constrained by structure, not trust:

- ✅ **Non-extractive** — No dark patterns, surveillance monetization, or coercive economics
- ✅ **Voluntary participation** — Entry and exit always allowed
- ✅ **Stability over speed** — Correctness and durability beat rapid growth
- ✅ **Bounded capital** — Capital is a tool, not a driver
- ✅ **Repairability first** — Tools and systems must be understandable and fixable

These principles are enforced by design choices, not promises.

## Proof Over Promises

Suns0lver demonstrates closed contribution loops:

- ✅ **Coin → Tool** — Funded, acquired, in use
- ⏳ **Code → Merge** — External contributions accepted (coming soon)
- ⏳ **Idea → Implementation** — With attribution (coming soon)
