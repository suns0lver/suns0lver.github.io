## SP007 — Failure Modes, Fatigue & Rework

---

## R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)

SP007 exists to ensure micro-assemblies **fail loudly, predictably, and repairably**.

Fatigue hides.  
Success masks damage.  
Rework windows close quickly.

If SP006 made it function, **SP007 decides whether it keeps functioning**.

Failure is not an accident here — it is an instrument.

---

## Core Principles

- Failure must be classifiable
- Fatigue accumulates even when invisible
- Rework is a consumable resource
- Mercy without evidence is denial

**R&D Value:**  
If you cannot break it on purpose, it will break you later.

---

## Phase 0 — Failure Taxonomy & Classification  
*(Language before blame)*

### Scope
- Failure classes and categories
- Mechanical, electrical, thermal, and hybrid modes
- First-pass classification rules

### Doctrine
- **Failure classes must be mutually exclusive at first pass**
- Unknown is a valid category and must remain visible
- Cosmetic success never overrides structural failure

**R&D Value:**  
Clarity prevents superstition.

---

## Phase 1 — Mechanical Fatigue & Stress Accumulation  
*(Motion leaves marks)*

### Scope
- Cyclic loading
- Vibration exposure
- Micro-strain accumulation

### Doctrine
- Fatigue is cumulative, not binary
- Absence of cracks is not absence of damage
- Mechanical stress logged alongside alignment state

**Estimated R&D Cost:** $2k – $12k  

**R&D Value:**  
Time remembers what snapshots forget.

---

## Phase 2 — Thermal Cycling & Environmental Stress  
*(Heat tells the truth)*

### Scope
- Thermal expansion mismatch
- Hot/cold cycling
- Localized thermal shock

### Doctrine
- Thermal stress treated as mechanical stress
- Cycling limits declared before testing
- Temperature gradients logged spatially and temporally

**Estimated R&D Cost:** $4k – $25k  

**R&D Value:**  
Most failures are thermal wearing a disguise.

---

## Phase 3 — Electrical Degradation & Overstress  
*(Electrons are relentless)*

### Scope
- Overcurrent
- Overvoltage
- Transient exposure
- Partial electrical failure

### Doctrine
- Electrical stress replayed, not guessed
- “Still works” is not a pass condition
- Electrical degradation linked to thermal and mechanical logs

**Estimated R&D Cost:** $3k – $15k  

**R&D Value:**  
Electrical lies compound quietly.

---

## Phase 4 — Combined Stress & Cross-Domain Failures  
*(Reality stacks stresses)*

### Scope
- Mechanical + thermal coupling
- Electrical + thermal runaway
- Alignment-sensitive failure cascades

### Doctrine
- Combined stress testing prioritized over isolated tests
- Cross-domain failure treated as first-order risk
- Alignment loss tracked as causal contributor

**Estimated R&D Cost:** $5k – $30k  

**R&D Value:**  
Systems fail at intersections.

---

## Phase 5 — Failure Replication & Replay  
*(Truth must repeat)*

### Scope
- Failure reproduction
- Stress replay sequences
- Controlled provocation

### Doctrine
- **A failure that cannot be re-induced is treated as unknown, not resolved**
- Replay conditions logged precisely
- Partial replication explicitly labeled

**Estimated R&D Cost:** $2k – $10k  

**R&D Value:**  
One-time failures teach nothing.

---

## Phase 6 — Rework Windows, Limits & Discipline  
*(Mercy is finite)*

### Scope
- Rework eligibility
- Rework attempt limits
- Degradation tracking

### Doctrine
- **Rework attempts are cumulative fatigue events**
- Rework limits declared before first attempt
- Infinite retries prohibited

**Estimated R&D Cost:** $1k – $6k  

**R&D Value:**  
Every fix costs lifespan.

---

## Phase 7 — Post-Failure Inspection & Evidence Preservation  
*(Look before you touch)*

### Scope
- Fracture inspection
- Residue analysis
- Sectioning and exposure

### Doctrine
- Evidence preserved before disassembly
- Photography precedes intervention
- Destructive analysis justified explicitly

**Estimated R&D Cost:** $2k – $12k  

**R&D Value:**  
Evidence dies quickly.

---

## Phase 8 — Lessons, Feedback & Doctrine Update  
*(Failure teaches forward)*

### Scope
- Root cause synthesis
- Doctrine updates
- Design feedback loops

### Doctrine
- Lessons must modify upstream SPs
- Failure insights linked to artifact ID
- “Known issues” without action are prohibited

**Estimated R&D Cost:** $500 – $4k  

**R&D Value:**  
Failure unused is failure repeated.

---

## Phase X — Instant Failure & Fatigue Capability via Market-Proven Tooling  
*(Reality before optimism)*

> **Phase X exists to acknowledge that fatigue testing infrastructure already exists — and rebuilding it poorly costs more than buying it well.**

Phase X provides a sanctioned path to **instant acquisition of proven failure, fatigue, and rework tooling** when doing so accelerates learning, preserves evidence, and prevents denial-driven decision-making.

Phase X is not a shortcut.  
Phase X is a **discipline against denial**.

---

### Scope
- Mechanical fatigue & vibration tools
- Thermal cycling & shock equipment
- Electrical stress & replay infrastructure
- Failure inspection & controlled rework tooling
- Documentation & failure memory systems

---

### Doctrine
- **If a tool helps you break things safely and repeatably, acquisition is preferred**
- Failure tooling must preserve evidence and allow replay
- Black-box “it failed” results without traceability are prohibited

---

### Instant Build-Out (Current Market Reference — High Rigor)

### Validation Criteria
- Failures reproducible on demand
- Stress conditions logged and replayable
- Evidence preserved post-failure
- Rework outcomes correlated with original failure mode
- Lessons feed back into SP001 doctrine

**R&D Value:**  
Breaking things on purpose is cheaper than being surprised.

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Motion & placement systems (SP002–SP004)
- Interconnect design (SP006)
- Automation orchestration (SP008)
- Yield optimization

---

## Status

**Current:** Failure doctrine locked  
**Phase X:** High-rigor instant build-out path established  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Failures classifiable  
✔ Fatigue visible  
✔ Rework bounded

### Why SP007 Matters

Systems don’t fail when they stop working.

They fail when nobody knows **why**.
