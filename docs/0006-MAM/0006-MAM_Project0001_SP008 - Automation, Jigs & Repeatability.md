## SP008 — Automation, Jigs & Repeatability

---

## R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)

SP008 exists to ensure that **what works once can work again — the same way**.

Automation amplifies mistakes.  
Jigs encode philosophy.  
Repeatability is measured, not assumed.

If SP004–SP007 proved it works once,  
**SP008 decides whether it deserves to work again.**

---

## Core Principles

- Automation is a force multiplier, not a validator
- Jigs are physical doctrine
- Repeatability outranks throughput
- Drift is inevitable; surprise is optional

**R&D Value:**  
Scale without discipline accelerates failure.

---

## Phase 0 — Automation Boundaries & Authority  
*(Discipline before machinery)*

### Scope
- What may be automated
- What must remain manual
- Authority limits and stop rules

### Doctrine
- **Any process that cannot be paused safely is prohibited from automation**
- Automation authority must be explicitly bounded
- Stop authority supersedes throughput

**Estimated R&D Cost:** $1k – $4k  

**R&D Value:**  
If you can’t stop it, you don’t control it.

---

## Phase 1 — Jigs, Fixtures & Physical Memory  
*(Philosophy made tangible)*

### Scope
- Datum strategies
- Fixture rigidity and compliance
- Wear surfaces and inspection points

### Doctrine
- **Jig wear is treated as drift, not maintenance**
- Jigs must expose alignment state, not hide it
- Fixtures inherit alignment law from SP001

**Estimated R&D Cost:** $5k – $30k  

**R&D Value:**  
Bad jigs teach bad habits perfectly.

---

## Phase 2 — Assisted & Semi-Automated Assembly  
*(Bounded motion only)*

### Scope
- Force-limited actuators
- Assisted presses
- Sequenced assembly steps

### Doctrine
- Automation may assist, never decide
- Force envelopes declared before motion
- One-off automation success rejected

**Estimated R&D Cost:** $8k – $45k  

**R&D Value:**  
Help is allowed. Authority is not.

---

## Phase 3 — Motion Coordination & Sequencing  
*(Logic before speed)*

### Scope
- Sequencing controllers
- Interlocks and dependencies
- Deterministic state machines

### Doctrine
- All sequences must be reversible to a known-safe state
- **Rollback must restore both logic and physical configuration**
- Timing assumptions logged explicitly

**Estimated R&D Cost:** $4k – $18k  

**R&D Value:**  
Fast lies repeat efficiently.

---

## Phase 4 — In-Line Verification & Auto-Gating  
*(Trust but verify)*

### Scope
- Vision checks
- Sensor-based verification
- Automated gating

### Doctrine
- **Auto-pass decisions require at least one independently verified signal**
- Verification metrics inherit SP005 uncertainty rules
- Gates are hard stops, not hints

**Estimated R&D Cost:** $6k – $30k  

**R&D Value:**  
Machines must prove what humans already doubt.

---

## Phase 5 — Drift Detection & Early Warning  
*(Catch it before it spreads)*

### Scope
- Trend analysis
- Tolerance erosion tracking
- Environmental correlation

### Doctrine
- Drift treated as system behavior, not anomaly
- Thresholds defined before production
- Early warning outranks post-mortem

**Estimated R&D Cost:** $2k – $12k  

**R&D Value:**  
Drift is cheaper early.

---

## Phase 6 — Human Override & Intervention Protocols  
*(Authority preserved)*

### Scope
- Override controls
- Intervention criteria
- Recovery paths

### Doctrine
- Human override always permitted
- Overrides logged and reviewed
- Automation never argues with stop authority

**Estimated R&D Cost:** $1k – $6k  

**R&D Value:**  
Humans are not a fallback — they are the check.

---

## Phase 7 — Repeatability Proof & Statistical Confidence  
*(Evidence, not hope)*

### Scope
- Repetition trials
- Variance measurement
- Confidence declaration

### Doctrine
- Repeatability demonstrated across cycles, not samples
- Variance limits declared explicitly
- Confidence degrades over time unless renewed

**Estimated R&D Cost:** $2k – $10k  

**R&D Value:**  
Once is anecdote. Many is evidence.

---

## Phase 8 — Documentation, Rollback & Stewardship  
*(Memory survives scale)*

### Scope
- Configuration logs
- Rollback procedures
- Training and knowledge transfer

### Doctrine
- Documentation must restore state, not describe intent
- Rollback paths tested regularly
- Stewardship survives personnel turnover

**Estimated R&D Cost:** $1k – $6k  

**R&D Value:**  
Memory prevents repetition of mistakes.

---

## Phase X — Instant Repeatability Capability via Market-Proven Automation Tooling  
*(Reality before scale)*

> **Phase X exists to acknowledge that disciplined automation tooling already exists — and rebuilding it poorly hard-codes mistakes faster.**

Phase X provides a sanctioned path to **instant acquisition of proven jigs, fixtures, and bounded automation platforms** when doing so improves repeatability, auditability, and drift detection faster than bespoke development.

Phase X is not a shortcut.  
Phase X is a **scale-restraint doctrine**.

---

### Scope
- Precision modular jig & fixture systems
- Semi-automated assembly stations
- Force-limited actuators
- Vision-assisted verification (SP005-linked)
- Versioned automation controllers with rollback
- Training and dry-run infrastructure

---

### Doctrine
- **If a tool reduces variance immediately, acquisition is preferred**
- Automation must pause safely and expose drift early
- Black-box automation without rollback is prohibited

---

### Validation Criteria
- Identical results achieved repeatedly within declared tolerance
- Drift detected before failure
- Automation pauses safely on anomaly
- Rollback restores logic and physical configuration
- Human override exercised and verified

**R&D Value:**  
Scale earned slowly survives longer.

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Motion authority beyond bounds (SP002)
- Joining & bonding decisions (SP003)
- Failure analysis (SP007)
- Yield optimization

## Status

**Current:** Repeatability doctrine locked  
**Phase X:** High-rigor instant build-out path established  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Variance bounded  
✔ Drift visible  
✔ Authority preserved

### Why SP008 Matters

Automation does not create discipline.

It reveals whether you had any.
