## SP010 — Documentation, Skill Transfer & Stewardship

---

## R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)

SP010 exists to ensure that **truth outlives its authors**.

If SP001–SP009 built truth,  
**SP010 keeps it alive.**

Precision without memory is decay.  
Skill without transfer is fragility.  
Systems without stewards are temporary.

---

## Core Principles

- Canon outranks consensus
- Skill must be demonstrable
- Memory must be portable
- Stewardship survives personnel change

**R&D Value:**  
What cannot be taught cannot be sustained.

---

## Phase 0 — Canon Definition & Authority  
*(Truth before agreement)*

### Scope
- Canon vs experimental separation
- Authority for canon modification
- Evidence thresholds

### Doctrine
- **Canon may only be modified by evidence, not consensus**
- Experimental knowledge is labeled explicitly
- Canon changes require traceable justification

**Estimated R&D Cost:** $500 – $3k  

**R&D Value:**  
Consensus drifts. Evidence anchors.

---

## Phase 1 — Process Documentation & Fidelity  
*(Write what actually happens)*

### Scope
- Step-by-step procedures
- Inputs, outputs, tolerances
- Preconditions and failure modes

### Doctrine
- **Any undocumented deviation is treated as a failure event**
- Procedures must be executable without author presence
- Ambiguity is a defect

**Estimated R&D Cost:** $2k – $8k  

**R&D Value:**  
Reality beats intention.

---

## Phase 2 — Visual, Temporal & Context Capture  
*(Seeing preserves nuance)*

### Scope
- Visual references
- Temporal sequencing
- Contextual annotations

### Doctrine
- Images and video augment, never replace, text
- Capture includes “what not to do”
- Context survives compression

**Estimated R&D Cost:** $3k – $12k  

**R&D Value:**  
Pictures reduce misinterpretation.

---

## Phase 3 — Training, Certification & Skill Decay Control  
*(Skills expire without practice)*

### Scope
- Training pathways
- Certification criteria
- Practice cadence

### Doctrine
- **Certification expires without demonstrated practice**
- Training records link to artifact IDs
- Skills degrade unless exercised

**Estimated R&D Cost:** $3k – $15k  

**R&D Value:**  
Skill is a perishable resource.

---

## Phase 4 — Decision Memory & Rationale Preservation  
*(Why matters as much as what)*

### Scope
- Decision logs
- Tradeoff documentation
- Rejected alternatives

### Doctrine
- Decisions recorded with evidence
- Reversals documented explicitly
- Silence equals loss

**Estimated R&D Cost:** $1k – $5k  

**R&D Value:**  
Rationale prevents repetition.

---

## Phase 5 — Human + Agent Readable Procedures  
*(Shared cognition)*

### Scope
- Structured documents
- Machine-parseable schemas
- Validation rules

### Doctrine
- **Machine-readable procedures must fail closed when incomplete**
- Human readability is mandatory
- Agents may assist, never author canon alone

**Estimated R&D Cost:** $2k – $8k  

**R&D Value:**  
Shared language prevents drift.

---

## Phase 6 — Stewardship, Ownership & Handoff  
*(Responsibility persists)*

### Scope
- Named stewards
- Handoff protocols
- Succession planning

### Doctrine
- Every domain has an active steward
- Stewardship transitions are documented events
- Orphaned knowledge is treated as risk

**Estimated R&D Cost:** $1k – $6k  

**R&D Value:**  
Ownership prevents neglect.

---

## Phase 7 — Audit, Review & Renewal  
*(Memory must be exercised)*

### Scope
- Periodic audits
- Staleness detection
- Renewal cadence

### Doctrine
- Documentation decays unless reviewed
- Stale canon is flagged loudly
- Renewal is scheduled, not optional

**Estimated R&D Cost:** $1k – $6k  

**R&D Value:**  
Unchecked memory rots.

---

## Phase 8 — Archival, Migration & Longevity  
*(Decades matter)*

### Scope
- Long-term storage
- Format migration
- Integrity checking

### Doctrine
- **At least one archival format must remain human-readable without software**
- Archives tested for retrieval
- Migration events logged

**Estimated R&D Cost:** $2k – $10k  

**R&D Value:**  
Survival requires foresight.

---

## Phase X — Instant Knowledge Continuity via Market-Proven Systems  
*(Reality before oral tradition)*

> **Phase X exists to acknowledge that durable knowledge systems already exist — and rebuilding them informally guarantees loss.**

Phase X provides a sanctioned path to **instant acquisition of proven documentation, training, archival, and stewardship tooling** when doing so preserves precision, intent, and continuity better than ad-hoc practices.

Phase X is not a shortcut.  
Phase X is a **memory-preservation doctrine**.

---

### Scope
- Structured documentation platforms
- Visual capture & annotation
- Training & certification systems
- Decision memory archives
- Human + agent schemas
- Long-term archival tooling

---

### Doctrine
- **If a system preserves knowledge across personnel change, acquisition is preferred**
- Documentation must be auditable and teachable
- Black-box “tribal knowledge” is prohibited

---

### Instant Build-Out (Current Market Reference — High Rigor)

> *Reference path — professional-grade documentation, training, and archival discipline.*

**Documentation & canon**
- Versioned documentation platform: $2k–$8k  
- Diagramming & illustration tools: $1k–$4k  
- Change tracking & diff tooling: $1k–$3k  

**Visual & temporal capture**
- High-resolution cameras & lenses: $3k–$10k  
- Video capture/edit workstation: $2k–$6k  
- Annotation & overlay software: $1k–$4k  

**Training & skill transfer**
- LMS / certification system: $2k–$8k  
- Assessment & competency tracking: $1k–$4k  
- Training rigs & mock assemblies: $2k–$6k  

**Decision memory**
- Decision record tooling: $1k–$3k  
- Cross-linking & search infrastructure: $1k–$4k  

**Human + agent interface**
- MD/JSON/YAML schema tooling: $1k–$4k  
- Glossary & terminology management: $500–$2k  
- Validation & linting tools: $1k–$3k  

**Archival & longevity**
- Redundant storage (on-site + off-site): $2k–$8k  
- Format migration & integrity tools: $1k–$4k  
- Periodic audit & renewal tooling: $1k–$3k  

**Estimated Instant Knowledge Continuity Capability:**  
➡️ **$25k – $45k typical**  
➡️ **$60k+ upper** (redundancy, richer media, audits)

**Recommended High-Rigor Planning Number:** **~$35k**

---

### Validation Criteria
- Procedures executable without authors present
- Knowledge survives personnel turnover
- Decisions traceable to evidence
- Agents parse procedures deterministically
- Archives readable decades later

**R&D Value:**  
What cannot be remembered cannot be sustained.

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Design changes (SP001–SP009)
- Automation logic
- Yield optimization

---

## Status

**Current:** Stewardship doctrine locked  
**Phase X:** Knowledge continuity path established  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Canon enforced  
✔ Skills transferable  
✔ Memory durable

### Why SP010 Matters

Projects end.

Stewardship continues.
