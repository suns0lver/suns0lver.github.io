## SP005 — Alignment Verification, Optical Systems & In-Process Metrology

---

## R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)

SP005 exists to ensure alignment **earns the right to continue**.

If SP001 defined alignment, SP005 is how alignment earns the right to proceed.

Pictures are not proof.  
Automation is not truth.  
Measurement without uncertainty is theater.

Verification must be:
- non-invasive
- traceable
- auditable
- repeatable across time

---

## Core Principles

- Verification gates are hard stops, not advisory checks
- Measurement must declare uncertainty
- Truth must survive time, tooling, and personnel turnover
- If you cannot verify it, you do not get to build it

**R&D Value:**  
SP005 prevents the system from believing itself.

---

## Phase 0 — Verification Ontology & Measurement Authority  
*(Language before measurement)*

### Scope
- Define what “verified” means
- Establish measurement authority hierarchy
- Set acceptance criteria and uncertainty doctrine

### Doctrine
- Verification is a state, not a feeling
- Uncertainty must be explicitly declared
- “Looks aligned” is invalid language

**R&D Value:**  
If you can’t name truth, you can’t keep it.

---

## Phase 1 — Optical Inspection Systems (Seeing Without Touching)  
*(Seeing before measuring)*

### Scope
- Microscopes, lenses, illumination
- Contrast methods (brightfield, darkfield, polarization)
- Operator viewing discipline

### Doctrine
- Seeing is allowed to suggest — never to conclude
- Lighting is treated as measurement infrastructure, not convenience
- Operator interpretation is bounded by documented criteria

**R&D Value:**  
Seeing starts the question.

---

## Phase 2 — Measurement-Grade Imaging & Digital Metrology  
*(Measuring before believing)*

### Scope
- Calibrated camera systems
- Pixel-to-world transforms
- Sub-pixel edge detection (bounded)

### Doctrine
- Calibration artifacts are required, not optional
- Every measurement includes a stated uncertainty band
- Software results must be reproducible across sessions

**R&D Value:**  
Numbers without calibration are stories.

---

## Phase 3 — Reference Frames, Fiducials & Coordinate Persistence  
*(Frames before time)*

### Scope
- Fiducial design and placement doctrine
- Coordinate systems and inheritance
- Alignment history attachment

### Doctrine
- Fiducials are consumable truth, audited for drift and damage
- Coordinate frames must survive handoff between tools and stages
- Provenance travels with assemblies

**R&D Value:**  
Frames make truth portable.

---

## Phase 4 — Z-Axis Truth & Non-Contact Profilometry  
*(Height before confidence)*

### Scope
- Z-height measurement
- Planarity, tilt, warp detection
- Non-contact methods (preferred)

### Doctrine
- Z-axis is first-order alignment truth, not “nice to have”
- Height verification is required before permanent joining
- Non-contact methods preferred to preserve alignment memory

**R&D Value:**  
Flatness is not assumed. It is proven.

---

## Phase 5 — In-Process Metrology & Verification Cadence  
*(Cadence before speed)*

### Scope
- When to measure (before/after critical actions)
- Gate placement in assembly flow
- Repeatability checks

### Doctrine
- Verification cadence declared before assembly begins
- Skipped gates must be treated as alignment-risk events
- Measurement intervals optimized for truth, not throughput

**R&D Value:**  
The fastest way to fail is to stop checking.

---

## Phase 6 — Assisted Verification & Automation (Bounded)  
*(Consistency before autonomy)*

### Scope
- Automated focus stacking
- Automated feature detection (bounded)
- Repeatable measurement routines

### Doctrine
- Automation reduces variance; it does not grant correctness
- Automated outputs must include uncertainty disclosure
- Human veto authority is preserved and explicit

**R&D Value:**  
Automation is a tool. Truth is the goal.

---

## Phase 7 — Verification Gates, Acceptance Criteria & Stop Authority  
*(Authority before progress)*

### Scope
- Gate criteria
- Fail/hold/rework routing
- Stop conditions

### Doctrine
- Gates are hard stops
- “Proceed anyway” requires explicit documented waiver
- Stop authority is immune to schedule, cost, or hierarchy

**R&D Value:**  
Stopping protects truth.

---

## Phase 8 — Metrology Memory, Provenance & Audit Trails  
*(Memory preserved)*

### Scope
- Measurement logs
- Calibration histories
- Artifact lineage and repeatability tracking

### Doctrine
- Verification results must be auditable across time
- Calibration records survive personnel turnover
- Measurement memory travels with assemblies

**R&D Value:**  
Memory prevents repetition.

---

## Phase X — Instant Verification Capability via Market-Proven Metrology  
*(Reality before belief)*

> **Phase X exists to acknowledge that verification systems already exist that tell the truth better than custom pipelines built in haste.**

Phase X provides a sanctioned path to **instant build-out of alignment verification capability** using market-proven optical and metrology systems when doing so preserves non-invasiveness, accuracy, and auditability better than bespoke development.

Phase X is not a shortcut.  
Phase X is a **truth-preservation doctrine**.

---

### Scope
- Commercial optical microscopes & inspection stations
- Calibrated measurement imaging stacks
- Non-contact Z-axis measurement platforms
- Fiducial tooling & traceable reference artifacts
- Vendor-supported metrology systems (auditable)

---

### Doctrine
- **If a commercial system measures alignment without disturbing it, acquisition is preferred**
- Verification systems must declare:
  - uncertainty
  - calibration traceability
  - coordinate frame handling
- Black-box measurement without calibration disclosure is prohibited

---

### Instant Build-Out (Current Market Reference — Highest Rigor Assumption)

> *Reference path — assumes highest resolution, traceability, and Z-axis rigor.*

High-rigor Phase X verification stack (indicative, 2026 market):

- Metrology-grade optical microscope (high-NA, LWD, stable stand): **$20,000**
- Measurement-grade camera + telecentric optics package: **$25,000**
- Metrology software suite (sub-pixel analysis, traceable workflows): **$10,000**
- Fiducial tooling + certified reference artifacts: **$6,000**
- Non-contact Z-axis system (profilometry / confocal / equivalent): **$40,000**
- Calibration services + traceable calibration artifacts: **$10,000**
- Rigid metrology mounting + lighting control infrastructure: **$12,000**
- Vibration control / isolation support (verification-class): **$18,000**

**Estimated Instant Verification Capability (High Rigor Total):**  
➡️ **~$141,000** (typical high-rigor stack)

**Budget Note:**  
Plan **$140k–$180k** if you want redundancy, faster turnaround, or multiple stations.

---

### Validation Criteria
- Measurement uncertainty explicitly declared
- Calibration traceable and repeatable
- Verification does not disturb alignment state
- Results auditable across time and assemblies
- Z-axis truth verified, not inferred

---

**R&D Value:**  
Truth purchased carefully is cheaper than truth rebuilt later.

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Motion control systems (SP002)
- Joining & bonding (SP003)
- Handling & manipulation (SP004)
- Automation orchestration and throughput scaling (SP008)

---

## Status

**Current:** Verification doctrine locked  
**Phase X:** High-rigor instant build-out path established

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Uncertainty declared  
✔ Z-axis proven  
✔ Memory enforced

### Why SP005 Matters

MAM does not scale by believing.

MAM scales by verifying.
