## SP002 — Micro Positioning, Stages & Motion Control

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP002 exists to **move things without disturbing their truth**.

Inertia is betrayal.  
Backlash is corruption.  
Open-loop motion is fiction.

**Motion is treated as a state transition, not a continuous action.**

---

## Core Principles
- Time dominates error before distance
- Unconstrained degrees of freedom become noise
- Feedback without declared limits lies

**R&D Value:**  
If motion isn’t bounded in time, it isn’t controlled.

---

## Phase 0 — Motion Ontology & Degrees of Freedom  
*(Ontology before hardware)*

### Scope
- Definition of allowable motion states
- Degrees of freedom (DOF) budgeting
- Constraint strategy

### Doctrine
- **Unused DOF must be mechanically constrained, not ignored**
- Motion authority declared before hardware selection
- Constraint hierarchy documented explicitly

**R&D Value:**  
Ignored DOF become future errors.

---

## Phase 1 — Linear Micro-Stages (Primary Axes)  
*(Linear before angular)*

### Scope
- Manual and motorized linear stages
- Travel limits and straightness
- Load handling

### Doctrine
- **Manual stages designated as truth references, not convenience tools**
- Straightness verified across full travel
- Preload preferred over compensation

**R&D Value:**  
Truth references move slowly.

---

## Phase 2 — Rotary & Angular Positioning  
*(Angular before piezo)*

### Scope
- Rotary stages
- Goniometers
- Tilt mechanisms

### Doctrine
- **Angular resolution verified at working radius, not encoder location**
- Runout evaluated under load
- Small angles treated as large risks

**R&D Value:**  
Leverage lies.

---

## Phase 3 — Piezoelectric Positioning & Fine Motion  
*(Piezo before feedback)*

### Scope
- Piezo stacks and flexures
- Fine positioning elements
- Hysteresis management

### Doctrine
- **Piezo hysteresis models treated as time-variant**
- Creep logged as temporal error
- Piezo used for trim, not authority

**R&D Value:**  
Fine motion drifts.

---

## Phase 4 — Closed-Loop Feedback & Encoders  
*(Feedback before control logic)*

### Scope
- Encoders
- Interferometry
- Sensor fusion

### Doctrine
- **Feedback loop bandwidth declared alongside resolution**
- Latency treated as first-order error
- Sensor alignment verified independently

**R&D Value:**  
Fast lies are still lies.

---

## Phase 5 — Motion Controllers & Control Logic  
*(Control before isolation)*

### Scope
- Motion controllers
- Tuning parameters
- Control software

### Doctrine
- **Controller tuning changes logged as system state changes**
- Control logic versioned explicitly
- Software authority never exceeds mechanical bounds

**R&D Value:**  
Software moves hardware.

---

## Phase 6 — Vibration Isolation & Dynamic Stability  
*(Isolation before time)*

### Scope
- Passive isolation
- Active isolation (bounded)
- Structural damping

### Doctrine
- **Isolation performance evaluated across the full motion envelope**
- Resonances mapped during motion, not at rest
- Floors treated as dynamic systems

**R&D Value:**  
Moving wakes the floor.

---

## Phase 7 — Thermal Drift & Time Stability  
*(Time before safety)*

### Scope
- Thermal expansion
- Time-dependent drift
- Compensation strategies

### Doctrine
- **Thermal compensation models invalidated automatically after hardware changes**
- Drift logged as time series
- Stability declared over time, not snapshots

**R&D Value:**  
Parts age.

---

## Phase 8 — Safety, Limits & Soft Stops  
*(Safety before memory)*

### Scope
- Hard limits
- Soft limits
- Collision prevention

### Doctrine
- **Soft-limit violations logged as alignment-risk events**
- Limits verified physically, not assumed
- Safety systems never mask alignment loss

**R&D Value:**  
Protection without truth is theater.

---
## Phase X — Instant Motion Capability via Market-Proven Systems  
*(Reality before reinvention)*

> **Phase X exists to acknowledge that motion is one of the fastest ways to destroy alignment when over-engineered.**

Phase X provides a sanctioned path to **instant acquisition of proven motion systems** when doing so preserves alignment, time, and truth better than bespoke design, tuning, or control-loop development.

Phase X is not a shortcut.  
Phase X is a **risk-reduction doctrine**.

---

### Scope
- Commercial micro-positioning stages (linear & rotary)
- Integrated XYZ + θ motion stacks
- Piezo positioning modules
- Encoder and feedback subsystems
- Vendor-supported motion platforms (auditable)

---

### Doctrine
- **If a commercial motion system reduces time-to-truth, acquisition is preferred**
- Motion authority must never exceed mechanical truth
- Purchased motion systems must declare:
  - resolution
  - repeatability
  - latency
  - drift
- Closed systems without observable feedback paths are prohibited

---

### Instant Build-Out (Current Market Reference)

> *Reference path — not default path*

Typical Phase X motion stack (indicative, 2026 market):

- Precision linear micro-stages (XYZ): **$10k–$30k**
- Rotary / goniometric stages: **$5k–$15k**
- Piezo fine-positioning modules: **$6k–$20k**
- Encoders / interferometric feedback: **$8k–$25k**
- Motion controller & drive electronics: **$5k–$15k**
- Vendor setup / calibration (optional): **$3k–$10k**

**Estimated Instant Motion Capability:**  
➡️ **$35k – $110k**, depending on resolution, observability, and thermal stability.

---

### Validation Criteria
- Motion repeatability verified under load
- Drift characterized over time, not snapshots
- Latency documented and bounded
- Feedback bandwidth declared and tested
- Motion performance does not degrade alignment state

---

**R&D Value:**  
Buying patience beats building frustration.


## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Joining and bonding processes
- Handling and manipulation tools
- Automation orchestration
- Cross-domain integration

---

## Status
**Current:** Motion doctrine locked  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ DOF constrained  
✔ Time bounded  
✔ Alignment preserved  

---

### Why SP002 Matters
Alignment survives only if motion respects time.

SP002 teaches machines patience.
