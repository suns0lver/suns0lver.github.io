# MAM · Project0001  
## Micro Assembly Mechanics — Project Decomposition

### Mission
Micro Assembly Mechanics (MAM) exists to:

- assemble tiny things without damaging them  
- align components without fighting physics  
- repeat motions without drift  
- translate precision into functional micro-systems  

**If you force alignment, you already failed.**

Micro-assembly is a craft.  
Crafts die without memory.

---

## Core Doctrine
- Alignment is treated as a **state**, not an action
- Motion errors emerge in **time before space**
- Repeatability outranks speed
- Automation exists to reduce variance, not impress observers

**R&D Value:**  
MAM turns static precision into living systems.

---

## SP001 — Philosophy, Alignment Doctrine & Flow
**Purpose:**  
Define how parts are allowed to meet.

**Clarified Doctrine:**
- **Alignment is treated as a state, not an action**
- Flow is designed to minimize re-alignment events
- Gravity, compliance, and reference planes used before force

**Boundary:**  
No tooling design here — only rules of engagement.

---

## SP002 — Micro Positioning, Stages & Motion Control
**Purpose:**  
Enable controlled movement without inducing stress.

**Clarified Doctrine:**
- **Closed-loop systems must declare latency and resolution explicitly**
- Drift tracked as time-dependent error
- Mechanical compliance preferred over digital correction

**Boundary:**  
No automation orchestration logic.

---

## SP003 — Fastening, Bonding & Joining at Micro Scale
**Purpose:**  
Join without imprinting future failure.

**Clarified Doctrine:**
- **Joining methods evaluated primarily on stress neutrality**
- Cure shrinkage and thermal effects treated as first-order risks
- Strength secondary to stability

**Boundary:**  
No material synthesis (see SPANCL).

---

## SP004 — Micro Handling, Pick-and-Place & Manipulation
**Purpose:**  
Move components without erasing history.

**Clarified Doctrine:**
- **Non-contact methods preferred when alignment history must be preserved**
- Handling force treated as data
- Human-in-the-loop respected at micro scale

**Boundary:**  
No full automation pipelines.

---

## SP005 — Inspection, Verification & In-Process Metrology
**Purpose:**  
Detect failure before it propagates.

**Clarified Doctrine:**
- **Verification gates are hard stops, not advisory checks**
- Inspection cadence defined before assembly begins
- Measurement uncertainty logged alongside results

**Boundary:**  
No post-hoc failure analysis (see SP007).

---

## SP006 — Micro-Scale Power, Signal & Interconnects
**Purpose:**  
Deliver energy and information without distortion.

**Clarified Doctrine:**
- **Thermal expansion mismatch treated as first-order interconnect risk**
- Signal integrity evaluated mechanically and electrically
- Power delivery designed to avoid mechanical preload

**Boundary:**  
No macro power systems (see BBAWE / NTIPS).

---

## SP007 — Failure Modes, Fatigue & Rework
**Purpose:**  
Understand limits before exceeding them.

**Clarified Doctrine:**
- **Rework limits defined before first assembly attempt**
- Fatigue treated as cumulative, not binary
- Cosmetic success never overrides structural truth

**Boundary:**  
No yield optimization (analysis only).

---

## SP008 — Automation, Jigs & Repeatability
**Purpose:**  
Stabilize outcomes without erasing craft.

**Clarified Doctrine:**
- **Automation success measured by variance reduction, not throughput**
- Jigs designed to preserve degrees of freedom
- Human override always permitted

**Boundary:**  
No lights-out automation fantasy.

---

## SP009 — Integration with MIFF, SPANCL & NTIPS
**Purpose:**  
Bridge micro systems into macro reality safely.

**Clarified Doctrine:**
- **Stress decoupling mandatory at all cross-scale interfaces**
- Interface loads treated as hostile by default
- Translation layers documented explicitly

**Boundary:**  
No system-level scaling decisions.

---

## SP010 — Documentation, Skill Transfer & Stewardship
**Purpose:**  
Ensure micro-assembly knowledge survives success.

**Clarified Doctrine:**
- **Tool lineage treated as part of assembly history**
- Skills documented as processes, not heroics
- Stewardship prioritized over efficiency

**Boundary:**  
No training programs — doctrine only.

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Material synthesis (SPANCL)
- Macro structural fabrication (MIFF)
- Grid-scale power systems (BBAWE / NTIPS)
- Blind automation pipelines

---

## Status
**Current:** Decomposition locked, doctrine clarified  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Alignment philosophy enforced  
✔ Motion bounded  
✔ Memory preserved

### Why MAM Matters
SPANCL proves truth at rest.  
MIFF proves truth at scale.  

**MAM proves truth survives motion.**
