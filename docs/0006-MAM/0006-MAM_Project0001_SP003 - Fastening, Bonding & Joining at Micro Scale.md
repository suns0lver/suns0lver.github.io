## SP003 — Fastening, Bonding & Joining at Micro Scale

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP003 exists to **hold alignment without introducing force**.

Fastening introduces stress.  
Bonding introduces chemistry.  
Heat introduces drift.  
Permanence introduces regret.

**Joining is treated as a commitment event, not a reversible adjustment.**

---

## Core Principles
- Retention outranks strength
- Stress neutrality outranks adhesion
- Time-domain behavior outranks instant success

**R&D Value:**  
If alignment survives the join, the join succeeded.

---

## Phase 0 — Joining Ontology & Decision Tree  
*(Choice before tools)*

### Scope
- Joining intent
- Permanence classification
- Reversibility assessment

### Doctrine
- **Decision tree must explicitly justify why less-permanent options were rejected**
- Commitment level declared before process selection
- Joining forbidden without declared exit strategy (even if unused)

**R&D Value:**  
Unjustified permanence is technical debt.

---

## Phase 1 — Micro Fasteners & Mechanical Retention  
*(Mechanics before chemistry)*

### Scope
- Screws, clamps, pins
- Elastic retention
- Mechanical capture

### Doctrine
- **Torque limits expressed directionally, not just in magnitude**
- Preload treated as alignment risk
- Fasteners evaluated on stress distribution, not holding force

**R&D Value:**  
Direction breaks things.

---

## Phase 2 — Adhesives & Chemical Bonding  
*(Chemistry before heat)*

### Scope
- Epoxies
- UV-cured adhesives
- Pressure-sensitive bonds

### Doctrine
- **Adhesive aging and creep treated as time-domain alignment risks**
- Cure shrinkage logged explicitly
- Adhesives selected for neutrality, not convenience

**R&D Value:**  
Glue lies slowly.

---

## Phase 3 — Thermal & Energy-Assisted Bonding  
*(Heat before metal)*

### Scope
- Localized heating
- Laser or resistive activation
- Energy-assisted joins

### Doctrine
- **Localized heating zones explicitly mapped against alignment reference frames**
- Thermal gradients treated as alignment forces
- Heat application logged as irreversible event

**R&D Value:**  
Heat moves truth.

---

## Phase 4 — Soldering, Brazing & Metallic Bonds (Bounded)  
*(Metal before cure)*

### Scope
- Low-temperature soldering
- Micro-brazing
- Metallic diffusion bonds

### Doctrine
- **Flux residues treated as latent chemical contaminants unless proven inert**
- Solidification shrinkage evaluated mechanically
- Metallic joins used only when chemistry and mechanics fail

**R&D Value:**  
Residue is memory.

---

## Phase 5 — Stress Management & Cure Discipline  
*(Cure before cleverness)*

### Scope
- Cure sequencing
- Post-join stabilization
- Stress relief

### Doctrine
- **Post-cure alignment verification required after full thermal equilibrium**
- Cure schedules treated as mechanical processes
- Walking away before equilibrium prohibited

**R&D Value:**  
Time finishes the job.

---

## Phase 6 — Non-Contact & Field-Assisted Joining  
*(Cleverness before proof)*

### Scope
- Magnetic capture
- Capillary self-alignment
- Field-assisted positioning

### Doctrine
- **Self-alignment methods bounded by explicit capture-range documentation**
- Field forces treated as hidden stressors
- Non-contact does not imply non-invasive

**R&D Value:**  
Magic needs limits.

---

## Phase 7 — Verification, Inspection & Integrity Testing  
*(Proof before mercy)*

### Scope
- Alignment verification
- Mechanical integrity checks
- Environmental stress probing

### Doctrine
- **Testing must probe failure modes relevant to downstream use**
- Generic pull tests insufficient
- Verification uncertainty logged explicitly

**R&D Value:**  
Context defines truth.

---

## Phase 8 — Failure Modes, Rework & Salvage Rules  
*(Mercy bounded)*

### Scope
- Join failure analysis
- Rework limits
- Salvage criteria

### Doctrine
- **Salvage decisions explicitly reference cumulative alignment damage**
- Cosmetic success never overrides structural truth
- Rework attempts logged as alignment risk events

**R&D Value:**  
Cosmetics lie.

---

## Phase X — Instant Joining Capability via Proven Processes  
*(Reality before cleverness)*

> **Phase X exists to acknowledge that permanence chosen poorly destroys alignment faster than motion ever could.**

Phase X provides a sanctioned path to **use proven joining tools, materials, or qualified external processes** when doing so preserves alignment, repeatability, and truth better than developing bespoke joining techniques.

Phase X is not a shortcut.  
Phase X is a **commitment discipline**.

---

### Scope
- Commercial micro-fasteners and retention systems
- Pre-qualified adhesive systems
- Certified micro-soldering / brazing services
- Vendor-supported bonding processes
- Pre-tested joining fixtures

---

### Doctrine
- **If a joining method has demonstrated alignment retention, reuse is preferred**
- Phase X joining does not bypass irreversibility doctrine
- Purchased processes inherit full MAM liability
- Black-box joining without post-join verification is prohibited

---

### Instant Build-Out (Current Market Reference)

> *Reference path — not default path*

Typical Phase X joining stack (indicative, 2026 market):

- Precision micro-fasteners & hardware kits: **$1k–$5k**
- Pre-qualified adhesive systems (UV, epoxy, PSA): **$2k–$6k**
- Controlled curing equipment (UV, thermal): **$3k–$10k**
- Micro-soldering / low-temp joining tools: **$4k–$12k**
- External micro-joining services (if required): **$5k–$20k**
- Inspection & post-join verification tooling: **$3k–$8k**

**Estimated Instant Joining Capability:**  
➡️ **$18k – $60k**, depending on permanence class and verification rigor.

---

### Validation Criteria
- Alignment verified after full thermal and chemical equilibrium
- Cure profiles disclosed and reproducible
- Stress introduction quantified or bounded
- Rework and salvage limits defined pre-join

---

**R&D Value:**  
Proven permanence beats clever permanence.


## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Motion control systems
- Handling and manipulation tools
- Automation pipelines
- Cross-domain integration

---

## Status
**Current:** Joining doctrine locked  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Commitment declared  
✔ Stress neutralized  
✔ Alignment preserved  

---

### Why SP003 Matters
Movement threatens alignment.

Joining decides whether alignment survives forever.
