## SP004 — Micro Handling, Pick-and-Place & Manipulation

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP004 exists to **move components without erasing their alignment history**.

At micro scale, movement is violence unless constrained.

**Any handling method that cannot be repeated is treated as a failure, even if it succeeds once.**

This SP is touch, not force.

---

## Core Principles
- Repeatability outranks dexterity
- Gentle force is still force
- Handling must preserve memory

**R&D Value:**  
If placement cannot be repeated, it cannot be trusted.

---

## Phase 0 — Handling Taxonomy & Risk Mapping  
*(Risk before tools)*

### Scope
- Handling modes
- Risk classification
- Force envelope definition

### Doctrine
- **Acceptable force envelopes expressed directionally, not just in magnitude**
- Risk ranked by alignment sensitivity
- Unknown handling modes prohibited

**R&D Value:**  
Direction matters more than intent.

---

## Phase 1 — Manual Precision Manipulation (Human-Guided)  
*(Humans before assistance)*

### Scope
- Tweezers
- Micro-probes
- Visual alignment aids

### Doctrine
- **Human tremor treated as a system variable, not a skill defect**
- Manual handling bounded by declared time limits
- Hands prohibited after alignment is declared

**R&D Value:**  
Skill does not cancel physics.

---

## Phase 2 — Assisted Placement & Semi-Automated Tools  
*(Assistance before fields)*

### Scope
- Assisted micro-tools
- Compliant holders
- Guided insertion aids

### Doctrine
- **Assisted tools must declare latency between input and motion explicitly**
- Compliance preferred over correction
- Overshoot logged as alignment-risk event

**R&D Value:**  
Time causes overshoot.

---

## Phase 3 — Vacuum, Capillary & Electrostatic Handling  
*(Fields before robots)*

### Scope
- Vacuum pickup
- Capillary effects
- Electrostatic attraction

### Doctrine
- **Release repeatability documented, not just pickup success**
- Field strengths bounded explicitly
- Residual forces treated as hidden stressors

**R&D Value:**  
Release is harder than capture.

---

## Phase 4 — Robotic Pick-and-Place (Bounded)  
*(Robots before verification)*

### Scope
- Micro-robotic handlers
- Repeatable placement routines
- Tool change protocols

### Doctrine
- **Automation acceptance based on variance reduction, not placement rate**
- Robots inherit human alignment law
- One-off robotic success rejected

**R&D Value:**  
Consistency beats speed.

---

## Phase 5 — Position Verification & Post-Placement Audit  
*(Verification before hygiene)*

### Scope
- Optical checks
- Fiducial alignment
- Post-placement confirmation

### Doctrine
- **Verification must occur before environmental equilibration hides handling damage**
- Acceptance requires uncertainty bounds
- Verification failures halt progression

**R&D Value:**  
Damage relaxes.

---

## Phase 6 — Contamination & Handling Hygiene  
*(Hygiene before recovery)*

### Scope
- Tool cleanliness
- Contact surface control
- Environmental exposure

### Doctrine
- **Handling tools treated as contamination sources with lifecycle limits**
- Tool condition logged as process input
- Cleanliness verified, not assumed

**R&D Value:**  
Tools age; doctrine endures.

---

## Phase 7 — Failure, Recovery & Re-Placement  
*(Recovery bounded)*

### Scope
- Misplacement recovery
- Realignment attempts
- Salvage criteria

### Doctrine
- **Recovery success defined as alignment preservation, not part survival**
- Re-placement attempts logged cumulatively
- Cosmetic recovery rejected

**R&D Value:**  
Survival isn’t success.

---

## Phase X — Instant Handling Capability via Mature Tooling  
*(Reality before heroics)*

> **Phase X exists to acknowledge that alignment is more often destroyed by hands than by machines.**

Phase X provides a sanctioned path to **acquire mature, market-proven handling tools and platforms** when doing so reduces variance, preserves alignment history, and outperforms bespoke handling solutions in repeatability and restraint.

Phase X is not a shortcut.  
Phase X is a **variance-reduction doctrine**.

---

### Scope
- Commercial micro-manipulators
- Lab-grade pick-and-place platforms
- Vacuum, capillary, and compliant handling tools
- Precision micro-robotic handlers (bounded)
- Vendor-supported handling systems (auditable)

---

### Doctrine
- **If a tool immediately reduces placement variance, acquisition is preferred**
- Phase X handling must:
  - respect declared force envelopes
  - preserve alignment history
- One-off successes are rejected
- Black-box handling without release characterization is prohibited

---

### Instant Build-Out (Current Market Reference)

> *Reference path — not default path*

Typical Phase X handling stack (indicative, 2026 market):

- Manual micro-manipulators / compliant tools: **$2k–$6k**
- Vacuum or capillary pickup systems: **$3k–$10k**
- Assisted placement platforms (semi-automated): **$6k–$18k**
- Lab-grade pick-and-place systems (bounded): **$15k–$45k**
- End-effector tooling & consumables: **$2k–$6k**
- Verification optics & placement inspection aids: **$4k–$12k**

**Estimated Instant Handling Capability:**  
➡️ **$25k – $90k**, depending on automation level and verification rigor.

---

### Validation Criteria
- Placement repeatability demonstrated across multiple cycles
- Release behavior characterized and documented
- Tool hygiene and lifecycle limits defined
- Handling variance does not degrade alignment state

---

**R&D Value:**  
Sometimes the best hands are already built.


## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Joining and bonding processes
- Motion control systems
- Automation orchestration at scale
- Macro logistics and transport

---

## Status
**Current:** Handling doctrine locked  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Force bounded  
✔ Repeatability proven  
✔ Memory preserved

### Why SP004 Matters
Hands decide whether alignment survives contact with reality.

SP004 teaches them restraint.
