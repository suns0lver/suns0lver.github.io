## SP001 — Philosophy, Alignment Doctrine & Flow

---

## R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)

Micro Assembly Mechanics (MAM) exists to **preserve alignment, not correct it**.

Alignment is not an outcome.  
Alignment is not a goal.  
Alignment is a **state that must be protected**.

Once alignment is lost, every subsequent action lies.

**Alignment loss is treated as an event, not a condition.**

At micro scale, alignment is not achieved — it is defended.

---

## Core Principles

- Alignment precedes assembly
- Force is evidence of failure
- Drift compounds silently
- Memory outlives motion
- Humility preserves truth better than ingenuity

**R&D Value:**  
Systems fail when they attempt to recover alignment instead of protecting it.

---

## Phase 0 — Alignment Ontology & Tolerance Philosophy  
*(Ontology before flow)*

### Scope
- Definition of alignment states
- Tolerance budgeting
- Margin ownership

### Doctrine
- **Tolerance budgets must declare where margin is intentionally spent**
- Borrowing tolerance without declaration is prohibited
- Zero-force alignment is preferred over corrective compensation

**R&D Value:**  
Hidden margin is stolen future.

---

## Phase 1 — Assembly Flow Doctrine (One-Way Logic)  
*(Flow before agency)*

### Scope
- Assembly sequencing
- Directional logic
- Irreversibility awareness

### Doctrine
- **Assembly flows are one-way by design**
- Reverse motion treated as failure unless pre-approved
- Reset events logged as alignment loss

**R&D Value:**  
Resets leave scars.

---

## Phase 2 — Manual vs Assisted vs Automated Boundaries  
*(Agency before reference)*

### Scope
- Human involvement limits
- Assisted tooling boundaries
- Automation constraints

### Doctrine
- **Human judgment bounded to pre-alignment and abort authority**
- No heroics after alignment declaration
- Automation never substitutes for alignment discipline

**R&D Value:**  
Hands remember force.

---

## Phase 3 — Alignment Reference Frames & Fiducials  
*(Reference before time)*

### Scope
- Master reference frames
- Fiducial systems
- Reference inheritance

### Doctrine
- **Master references audited for wear, drift, and contamination**
- Fiducials treated as consumable truth
- Reference degradation logged explicitly

**R&D Value:**  
Ground truth drifts too.

---

## Phase 4 — Drift, Time & Environmental Awareness  
*(Time before touch)*

### Scope
- Thermal drift
- Vibration coupling
- Environmental instability

### Doctrine
- **Alignment half-life declared per material and environment**
- Time limits set before alignment begins
- Environmental change treated as alignment risk

**R&D Value:**  
Time is an active force.

---

## Phase 5 — Handling, Touch & Contact Rules  
*(Touch before abort)*

### Scope
- Contact permissions
- Force envelopes
- Handling constraints

### Doctrine
- **Contact force limits expressed directionally, not just in magnitude**
- Any contact logged as alignment event
- Incidental touch prohibited post-alignment

**R&D Value:**  
Direction breaks things.

---

## Phase 6 — Stop Conditions, Abort Rules & Reset Rituals  
*(Abort before verification)*

### Scope
- Abort triggers
- Reset authority
- Ritualized re-entry

### Doctrine
- **Abort authority immune to schedule, cost, or hierarchy**
- Aborts logged as preservation successes
- Reset rituals required before re-alignment

**R&D Value:**  
Stopping protects truth.

---

## Phase 7 — Alignment Verification Gates  
*(Verification before memory)*

### Scope
- Verification checkpoints
- Acceptance criteria
- Uncertainty declaration

### Doctrine
- **Verification failure erases alignment history**
- Gates are hard stops, not advisory
- Acceptance requires explicit uncertainty bounds

**R&D Value:**  
Passing once means nothing.

---

## Phase 8 — Knowledge Capture & Alignment Memory  
*(Memory preserved)*

### Scope
- Alignment narratives
- Drift histories
- Institutional memory

### Doctrine
- **Anecdotal drift converted into enforceable rules**
- Alignment memory travels with assemblies
- Memory audited periodically

**R&D Value:**  
Stories harden into law.

---

## Phase X — Instant Alignment Capability via Market-Proven Systems  
*(Reality before reinvention)*

> **Phase X exists to acknowledge that alignment can be destroyed faster by over-engineering than by careful acquisition.**

Phase X provides a sanctioned path to **instant build-out using existing, market-proven alignment systems** when doing so better preserves alignment, time, and truth than bespoke development.

Phase X is not a shortcut.  
Phase X is a **discipline check**.

---

### Scope
- Commercial alignment platforms
- Precision optical tables and frames
- Certified metrology stages
- External alignment services (bounded, auditable)

---

### Doctrine
- **If an existing system preserves alignment better than a custom build, acquisition is preferred**
- Ego-driven reinvention is an alignment violation
- Purchased systems inherit full MAM alignment law
- Black-box systems without observability are prohibited

---

### Instant Build-Out (Current Market Reference)

> *Reference path — not default path*

Typical Phase X alignment stack (indicative, 2026 market):

- Precision optical table & isolation frame: **$15k–$40k**
- Commercial micro-alignment stages (XYZ + θ): **$8k–$25k**
- Fiducial & reference tooling: **$2k–$6k**
- Entry-level interferometric / optical metrology: **$10k–$35k**
- Calibration & setup services (if external): **$5k–$15k**

**Estimated Instant Alignment Capability:**  
➡️ **$40k – $120k**, depending on resolution, stability, and auditability.

---

### Validation Criteria
- Alignment repeatability exceeds in-house prototype capability
- Reference frames auditable and stable over time
- No undocumented correction layers
- Full verification possible post-integration

---

**R&D Value:**  
Alignment survives humility better than pride.

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Motion systems (SP002)
- Joining & bonding (SP003)
- Handling & manipulation (SP004)
- Automation orchestration

---

## Status

**Current:** Alignment doctrine locked  
**Phase X:** Authorized reference path  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Margin declared  
✔ Flow irreversible  
✔ Memory enforced

### Why SP001 Matters

You cannot force alignment into existence.

You can only **refuse to destroy it**.
