## SP-001 — Structural & Spatial Architecture

### Purpose
Enable site preparation, structural feasibility studies, and early construction readiness for a closed vertical growing environment.

This wishlist prioritizes access, leveling, lifting, and verification over permanent construction.  
Cost ranges are provided for transparency and planning — not as purchase commitments.

---

## Phase 0 — Site Verification & Ground Truth  
*(No building without knowing the ground)*

### Survey & Geotechnical
- Topographic + boundary survey  
  ~$2k – $10k
- Geotechnical soil analysis (borings, compaction, frost depth)  
  ~$5k – $25k
- Environmental baseline assessment  
  ~$3k – $15k

**R&D Value:**  
Defines all load, drainage, and foundation assumptions. This is non-negotiable reality.

---

## Phase 1 — Earth Moving & Leveling  
*(Benchmarking professional-grade site prep)*

### Heavy Equipment (Rental / Access Preferred)
- Compact excavator (5–8 ton class)  
  ~$40k–$90k (buy) | $300–$600/day (rent)
- Compact track loader / skid steer  
  ~$35k–$75k | $250–$500/day
- Small–mid bulldozer (D3–D5 class)  
  ~$150k–$350k | $800–$2k/day
- Dump truck access (short haul)  
  ~$80k–$200k | $100–$150/hr

### Attachments
- Grading bucket / blade  
  ~$1k–$5k
- Vibratory plate compactor / roller  
  ~$3k–$20k
- Auger (test piers / pilings)  
  ~$2k–$8k

**R&D Value:**  
Establishes what professional-quality site prep actually requires.

---

## Phase 2 — Lifting & Assembly Capability  
*(Studying safe, repeatable vertical handling)*

### Vertical Lift
- Mobile crane (30–50 ton class)  
  ~$250k–$600k | $200–$400/hr
- Telehandler (reach forklift)  
  ~$70k–$150k | $300–$600/day

### Rigging & Safety (Buy Once)
- Rated slings, shackles, spreader bars  
  ~$2k–$10k
- PPE (helmets, harnesses, barriers)  
  ~$1k–$5k

**R&D Value:**  
Understanding lift envelopes, safety margins, and assembly sequencing before scale.

---

## Phase 3 — Structural Mockups & Measurement  
*(Validate before committing)*

### Materials (Samples, Not Bulk)
- Structural steel sections (I-beam, box, angle)  
  ~$2k–$10k
- Concrete test forms & reinforcement  
  ~$1k–$5k
- Vibration-damping materials  
  ~$1k–$8k

### Measurement & Metrology
- Rotary laser level / laser scanner  
  ~$1k–$8k
- Total station (or access)  
  ~$8k–$30k
- Load cells / strain gauges  
  ~$2k–$15k
- Vibration sensors  
  ~$1k–$10k

**R&D Value:**  
Turns structural assumptions into measured data.

---

## Phase 4 — Temporary Site Infrastructure  
*(Cold-climate survivability matters)*

- Portable generator + distribution  
  ~$3k–$15k
- Temporary lighting towers  
  ~$2k–$10k
- Weather shelters / tarps  
  ~$500–$5k
- Heated storage / site enclosure  
  ~$3k–$20k

**R&D Value:**  
Maintains productivity and safety during early phases.

---

## Phase X — Reference Only  
### Full-Scale Instant Buildout Cost (Non-Binding)

> This phase represents a hypothetical, immediate full-scale construction scenario using current market pricing.  
> It is not part of Phases 0–4 and does not represent planned expenditure.  
> Included to anchor expectations and support future ARGENT-based reinvestment modeling.

### Assumptions
- ~20 floors
- ~4 m floor-to-floor height (~80 m total)
- Steel + reinforced concrete hybrid
- Cold-climate design (snow, wind, frost)
- No luxury finishes
- Structure + core + basic enclosure only

### Order-of-Magnitude Cost Reference

- Primary structural steel (fabricated & delivered):  
  **$16M – $52M**
- Reinforced concrete (foundations, slabs, cores):  
  **$12M – $35M**
- Structural core systems (elevators, stairs, risers):  
  **$8M – $25M**
- Building envelope (basic):  
  **$15M – $40M**
- Heavy equipment, cranes, crews (structure-only phase):  
  **$20M – $60M**

**Reference Total (Structure + Core + Envelope only):**  
> **~$70M – $200M+ USD**

This reference excludes all grow systems, automation, energy systems, processing, land, permits, financing, and contingency.

## Contribution Modes (Explicit)
- Equipment access or rental sponsorship
- Professional services (surveying, crane operations)
- Material samples
- Targeted funding earmarked for SP-001 only
- Comparative insight (“we use X instead of Y because…”)

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope (Current)
- Permanent foundations
- Full steel fabrication
- Long-term heavy equipment ownership
- Construction crews at scale

These belong to later gates (post-validation).
