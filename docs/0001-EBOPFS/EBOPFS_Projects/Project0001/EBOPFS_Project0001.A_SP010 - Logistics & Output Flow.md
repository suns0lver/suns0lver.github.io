## SP-010 — Logistics & Output Flow

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP-010 exists to design, benchmark, and validate end-to-end material flow from harvest to handoff, ensuring:
- Minimal time from cut → cold storage → delivery
- Zero cross-contamination
- Graceful handling of delays, outages, and human intervention
- Clean interfaces with processing, packaging, and external distribution

This SP is about continuity, not speed for speed’s sake.

---

## Phase 0 — Flow Mapping & Time Budgeting  
*(Before conveyors move)*

### System Mapping
- Harvest → processing → packaging → storage → dispatch
- Time-at-temperature analysis
- Bottleneck identification
- Human vs machine handoff points

**~$2k – $10k**

**R&D Value:**  
Prevents “fast machines feeding slow doors.”

---

## Phase 1 — Internal Transport (Tower Side)

### Material Movement
- Food-grade conveyor systems (modular)  
  ~$5k – $50k
- AGVs / AMRs (shared with SP-006)  
  ~$20k – $100k per unit
- Vertical transport interfaces (elevators, lifts)  
  ~$10k – $80k

**Design Principle:**  
Flow must pause safely, not collapse.

**R&D Value:**  
Keeps output steady even when subsystems hiccup.

---

## Phase 2 — Buffering, Queuing & Staging

### Staging Infrastructure
- Short-term buffer racks (cold-rated)  
  ~$2k – $15k
- FIFO staging systems
- Zone-isolated holding areas

### Targets
- Prevent pileups
- Preserve batch identity
- Support partial loads

**R&D Value:**  
Turns variability into something survivable.

---

## Phase 3 — Cold Chain Handoff

### Cold Transfer Systems
- Dock-adjacent cold rooms  
  ~$5k – $40k
- Insulated transfer carts  
  ~$1k – $6k
- Rapid chill interfaces (blast or staged cooling)  
  ~$3k – $20k

**R&D Value:**  
Maintains quality between packaging and departure.

---

## Phase 4 — Outbound Dispatch & Distribution Interfaces

### Dispatch Equipment
- Loading docks (modular / temporary)  
  ~$3k – $25k
- Palletization systems  
  ~$2k – $15k
- Weigh and verification stations  
  ~$500 – $5k

### Transport Interfaces
- Local delivery vehicle integration
- Reusable crate systems
- Tamper-evident seals

**R&D Value:**  
Ensures accountability once product leaves the building.

---

## Phase 5 — Traceability & Audit Continuity

### Batch Continuity
- Scan points (QR / RFID) at every handoff  
  ~$300 – $3k per zone
- Timestamped transfer logs
- Automated exception reporting

**Design Principle:**  
A batch should never “disappear” between systems.

**R&D Value:**  
Protects trust, enables recalls, and supports transparency.

---

## Phase 6 — Human Factors & Failure Handling

### Human Interfaces
- Clear visual flow indicators
- Manual reroute paths
- Training signage and SOP stations

### Failure Scenarios
- Missed pickup
- Cold storage saturation
- Equipment downtime
- Power interruption

**~$1k – $8k**

**R&D Value:**  
Prevents logistics from becoming a single point of failure.

---

## Phase X — Reference Only  
### Instant Full-Scale Build-Out @ Current Market Prices (Non-Binding)

> This phase represents a hypothetical, immediate deployment of full-scale logistics and output flow infrastructure using current market pricing.  
> It is not part of Phases 0–6 and does not represent planned expenditure.  
> Included to anchor realism and support future ARGENT-based reinvestment modeling.

### Assumptions
- ~20 floors
- Continuous harvest and packaging output
- Tight cut-to-cold timelines
- High batch integrity and traceability requirements
- Redundancy prioritized over minimum equipment count
- Mixed human–machine logistics

### Why SP-010 Completes Project0001.A
Without SP-010:
- food spoils quietly
- trust erodes
- systems back up
- labor burns out

SP-010 ensures everything upstream actually reaches people intact.
