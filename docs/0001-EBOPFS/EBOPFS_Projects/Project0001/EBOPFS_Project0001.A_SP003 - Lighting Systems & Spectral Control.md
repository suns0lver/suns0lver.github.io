## SP-003 — Lighting Systems & Spectral Control

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP-003 exists to benchmark and study the highest-performance horticultural lighting systems in order to:
- Understand spectral effects on yield, flavor, and nutrition
- Validate uniformity at scale
- Quantify efficiency vs. heat vs. control tradeoffs
- Inform Suns0lver-grade luminaire design later

Cost ranges reflect best-in-class commercial and research equipment, not budget grow lights.

## Phase 0 — Photobiology & Requirements Definition  
*(Before fixtures are chosen)*

### Analysis & Modeling
- Crop-specific light response mapping (microgreens focus)
- Target PAR / PPFD ranges by growth stage
- Photoperiod and DLI modeling
- Canopy penetration analysis (dense trays)

**~$3k – $15k**

**R&D Value:**  
Prevents guessing. Establishes biological truth before hardware.

---

## Phase 1 — Benchmark Luminaire Systems

### High-End Horticultural Fixtures (Evaluation Units)
- Tunable full-spectrum LED luminaires  
  ~$800 – $3,000 per fixture
- Research-grade spectral engines (multi-channel, narrow-band control)  
  ~$3,000 – $10,000 per unit

### Required Capabilities
- Independent channel control (R / B / G / FR / UV-A)
- Dimmable without spectral shift
- Low flicker (machine-vision compatibility)
- Sealed, cleanable housings

**R&D Value:**  
Defines the ceiling of spectral precision and uniformity.

---

## Phase 2 — Spectral Measurement & Verification  
*(Metrology is non-optional)*

### Measurement Equipment
- Quantum PAR meters (PPFD)  
  ~$500 – $2,000
- Research-grade spectroradiometer  
  ~$8,000 – $35,000
- Canopy uniformity mapping tools  
  ~$1k – $5k

**R&D Value:**  
Trust nothing without measurement. This separates science from marketing.

---

## Phase 3 — Thermal & Power Characterization

### Heat & Power Analysis
- IR thermal cameras  
  ~$1k – $10k
- Power analyzers (true RMS, logging)  
  ~$500 – $5k
- Fixture heat-sink evaluation (air vs passive)

**R&D Value:**  
Lighting that cooks plants or buildings is a systems failure.

---

## Phase 4 — Rack-Integrated Lighting Hardware

### Mechanical Interfaces
- Adjustable mounting rails
- Height-adjustable brackets
- Anti-vibration mounts
- Quick-disconnect power/data couplers

**~$1k – $8k per rack system**

**R&D Value:**  
Ensures lighting works with SP-002 racks, not against them.

---

## Phase 5 — Control Interfaces (Hardware Side Only)

*(Logic & AI live in SP-007 — this is physical compatibility)*

- Dimmable drivers (0–10V, DALI, DMX)
- Addressable lighting controllers
- Hard-kill safety interlocks
- Emergency lighting fallback

**~$2k – $15k**

**R&D Value:**  
Prevents lighting from becoming a single point of failure.

---

## Phase 6 — Degradation & Lifecycle Testing

### Longevity Evaluation
- LED lumen depreciation tracking (L90 / L80)
- Spectral drift measurement over time
- Washdown & humidity stress testing

**~$1k – $10k**

**R&D Value:**  
Avoids systems that perform well for 6 months and lie thereafter.

---

## Phase X — Reference Only  
### Instant Full-Scale Build-Out @ Current Market Prices (Non-Binding)

> This phase represents a hypothetical, immediate full-scale lighting deployment using current market pricing.  
> It is not part of Phases 0–6 and does not represent planned expenditure.  
> Included to anchor realism and support future ARGENT-based reinvestment modeling.

### Why SP-003 Is Critical (Plain Truth)
Bad lighting:
- wastes energy
- distorts data
- hides plant stress
- breaks automation

SP-003 ensures the photons tell the truth.
