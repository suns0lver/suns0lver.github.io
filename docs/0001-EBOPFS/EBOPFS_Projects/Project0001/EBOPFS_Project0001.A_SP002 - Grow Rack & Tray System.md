## SP-002 — Grow Rack & Tray Systems

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP-002 exists to benchmark and study the highest-quality grow rack and tray systems available, in order to:
- Understand mechanical tolerances at scale
- Eliminate vibration, sag, and drift
- Ensure biological consistency
- Inform Suns0lver-grade designs later

Cost ranges reflect best-in-class, not lowest bid.

## Phase 0 — Biological & Mechanical Requirements Definition  
*(Before buying anything)*

### Analysis & Spec Work
- Crop density and root zone depth analysis
- Load per tray (wet + dry mass)
- Deflection tolerance targets (mm-scale)
- Cleaning and sterilization workflow mapping

**~$2k – $10k** (consultation + modeling)

**R&D Value:**  
Defines what “precision” actually means in plant terms.

---

## Phase 1 — Rack Structural Systems (Benchmark Units)

### Vertical Rack Frames
- Food-grade stainless steel rack systems (316L preferred)  
  ~$8k – $25k per rack section
- High-precision aluminum extrusion systems (industrial grade)  
  ~$5k – $15k per rack

### Targets
- Zero permanent deformation under load
- Modular reconfiguration
- Tool-less or minimal-tool service access

**R&D Value:**  
Understanding stiffness, corrosion resistance, and lifecycle cost.

---

## Phase 2 — Tray Systems  
*(Where Biology Meets Engineering)*

### Grow Trays (Benchmark)
- Injection-molded, food-safe trays (HDPE / PP)  
  ~$15 – $40 per tray
- CNC-machined tray prototypes (tolerance testing)  
  ~$200 – $800 per tray

### Tray Specs
- ~1.2 m × 0.6 m footprint
- Stackable
- Warp-resistant
- Smooth radii (no pathogen traps)

**R&D Value:**  
Identifies failure points in mass production vs precision.

---

## Phase 3 — Substrate & Interface Systems

### Substrates (Study & Comparison)
- Hemp fiber mats  
  ~$0.50 – $2 / tray
- Coconut coir mats  
  ~$0.50 – $1.50 / tray
- Reusable synthetic substrates  
  ~$2 – $10 / tray

### Interface Layers
- Drainage meshes
- Root aeration layers
- Reusable liners

**~$1k – $5k** total for test batches

**R&D Value:**  
Determines root health, water distribution, and cleanup effort.

---

## Phase 4 — Tray Handling & Access Hardware

### Mechanical Interfaces
- Slide rails (stainless / polymer)
- Anti-vibration mounts
- Quick-release locking mechanisms

**~$1k – $10k per rack system**

**R&D Value:**  
Prevents micro-movement that leads to crop inconsistency.

---

## Phase 5 — Cleaning, Sanitation & Lifecycle Testing

### Cleaning Infrastructure
- Commercial tray washers (food-grade)  
  ~$10k – $50k
- Steam sanitation systems  
  ~$3k – $15k
- Chemical-free sterilization (UV, ozone)  
  ~$2k – $20k

**R&D Value:**  
Ensures biosecurity without chemical dependence.

---

## Phase 6 — Sensors & Embedded Verification (Interface Only)

*(Control logic lives in SP-007; hardware compatibility only)*

- Tray weight sensors  
  ~$50 – $300 per node
- Moisture sensors  
  ~$20 – $150 per node
- RFID / QR tray tracking  
  ~$5 – $25 per tray

**R&D Value:**  
Enables traceability and per-tray accountability.

## Phase X — Reference Only  
### Instant Full-Scale Build-Out @ Current Market Prices (Non-Binding)

> This phase represents a hypothetical, immediate full-scale deployment using current market pricing.  
> It is not part of Phases 0–6 and does not represent planned expenditure.  
> Included to support realism, scheduling tradeoffs, and future ARGENT reinvestment logic.

### Assumptions
- ~20 floors
- ~20,000 trays per floor (~400,000 trays total)
- High-density microgreens configuration
- Stainless or aluminum rack systems
- Speed prioritized over optimization

### Order-of-Magnitude Cost Reference

#### Rack Structures
- Industrial stainless/aluminum rack systems  
  **$250 – $600 per tray position**

➡️ **~$100M – $240M**

---

#### Trays (Injection Molded, Bulk)
- Food-safe HDPE / PP trays  
  **$12 – $25 per tray (bulk)**

#### Substrates (Annualized)
- Mixed reusable + consumable substrates

➡️ **~$2M – $6M / year**

---

#### Cleaning & Sanitation Infrastructure
- Industrial washers, steam, UV/ozone
- Redundancy for continuous ops

➡️ **~$5M – $15M**

---

### Reference Total (SP-002 Only)
> **~$120M – $300M+ USD**

This excludes:
- Structural tower
- Lighting
- Irrigation
- Robotics
- Control software
- Energy systems
- Labor
- Land
- Permits

---

## Contribution Modes (Explicit)
- Benchmark equipment loans
- Manufacturer partnerships (evaluation units)
- Materials science input (plastics, coatings)
- Precision fabrication expertise
- Targeted funding earmarked for SP-002 only

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Lighting systems (SP-003)
- Irrigation plumbing (SP-004)
- Robotics (SP-006)
- Control software (SP-007)

Interfaces only — no scope bleed.

## Status
**Current:** R&D benchmarking  
**Next Gate:**  
✔ Mechanical tolerances validated  
✔ Tray lifecycle cost understood  
✔ Sanitation workflow proven

### Why This Matters (Bluntly)
If trays sag, vibrate, warp, or contaminate:
- yields lie
- data lies
- automation fails

SP-002 is where truth enters the plant system.
