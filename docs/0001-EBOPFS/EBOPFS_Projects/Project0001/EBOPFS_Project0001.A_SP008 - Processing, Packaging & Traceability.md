## SP-008 — Processing, Packaging & Traceability

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP-008 exists to benchmark food-safe processing and traceability systems that:
- Preserve freshness and nutrition
- Prevent contamination
- Provide end-to-end batch visibility
- Integrate cleanly with upstream automation

If it wouldn’t pass a professional food audit, it doesn’t enter the system.

---

## Phase 0 — Food Safety & Workflow Definition  
*(Before machines)*

### Analysis & Planning
- HACCP plan (microgreens-specific)
- Allergen and contamination risk mapping
- Cut-to-cool timing targets
- Cleaning and sanitation SOPs

**~$2k – $10k**

**R&D Value:**  
Defines compliance and trust before capital spend.

---

## Phase 1 — Harvest Handling & Pre-Processing

### Handling Infrastructure
- Food-grade harvest bins and carts  
  ~$500 – $5k
- Stainless prep tables (washdown-rated)  
  ~$1k – $6k
- Ergonomic trim tools (food-safe)  
  ~$300 – $2k

**Design Principle:**  
Minimize handling steps; maximize cleanliness.

**R&D Value:**  
Reduces bruising, contamination, and labor strain.

---

## Phase 2 — Washing, Drying & Sanitation

### Wash Systems
- Produce washers (gentle agitation)  
  ~$5k – $40k
- Ozone / UV water treatment (chemical-free)  
  ~$2k – $20k

### Drying
- Centrifugal dryers (greens-safe)  
  ~$3k – $15k
- Air-knife or filtered airflow drying  
  ~$2k – $12k

**R&D Value:**  
Controls microbial load without damaging delicate crops.

---

## Phase 3 — Packaging Systems (Freshness First)

### Packaging Equipment
- Semi-automatic weigh–fill systems  
  ~$5k – $25k
- Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) evaluation units  
  ~$10k – $60k
- Heat sealers (food-grade)  
  ~$1k – $8k

### Materials (Benchmarking)
- Compostable films
- Recyclable rigid containers
- Moisture-control inserts

**~$2k – $10k (test batches)**

**R&D Value:**  
Balances shelf life, sustainability, and product integrity.

---

## Phase 4 — Labeling & Batch Traceability

### Identification & Tracking
- Industrial label printers  
  ~$500 – $5k
- QR / DataMatrix labeling systems  
  ~$300 – $3k
- RFID evaluation kits (optional)  
  ~$1k – $8k

### Data Integration (Interface Only)
Batch IDs linked to:
- Tray ID
- Harvest time
- Wash parameters
- Packaging run

**R&D Value:**  
Enables recall, transparency, and trust without drama.

---

## Phase 5 — Cold Chain & Short-Term Storage

### Storage
- Walk-in cooler / reach-in units  
  ~$5k – $40k
- Temperature and humidity logging  
  ~$300 – $3k

### Targets
- Rapid cool-down post-harvest
- Stable 2–4 °C storage (crop-dependent)

**R&D Value:**  
Protects quality between harvest and delivery.

---

## Phase 6 — QA, Auditing & Verification

### Quality Control
- ATP hygiene testing kits  
  ~$200 – $1k
- Microbial testing access (lab partnership)  
  ~$1k – $10k
- Scales and check-weigh systems  
  ~$300 – $3k

**R&D Value:**  
Turns “we think it’s clean” into measured confidence.

---

## Phase X — Reference Only  
### Instant Full-Scale Build-Out @ Current Market Prices (Non-Binding)

> This phase represents a hypothetical, immediate full-scale processing, packaging, and traceability deployment using current market pricing.  
> It is not part of Phases 0–6 and does not represent planned expenditure.  
> Included to anchor realism and support future ARGENT-based reinvestment modeling.

### Assumptions
- ~20 floors
- ~20,000 trays per floor (~400,000 trays)
- Continuous harvest and packaging flow
- High-throughput, audit-ready food handling
- Redundancy prioritized over minimum equipment count
- Short cold-chain dwell times

### Why SP-008 Matters
This is where trust is earned or lost.

If people touch it, eat it, or serve it — it must be impeccable.

SP-008 ensures what leaves the tower is worthy of the work that made it.
