## SP-006 — Robotics & Automation Hardware

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP-006 exists to study and validate robotic handling, transport, and manipulation in dense vertical farming environments, with priorities on:
- Gentle biological handling
- Repeatable precision at scale
- Maintainability and fault tolerance
- Human-override and safe failure

We are not chasing “lights-out hype.”  
We are chasing trustworthy motion.

## Phase 0 — Task & Motion Decomposition  
*(Before robots are chosen)*

### Workflow Definition
- Tray preparation (empty → seeded)
- Transport (rack ↔ processing)
- Harvest handling
- Cleaning and return flow

### Motion Requirements
- Payload ranges (wet trays)
- Positional accuracy targets
- Cycle time bounds (no rush theater)
- Acceptable failure modes

**~$3k – $15k**

**R&D Value:**  
Defines what needs automation and what should stay human.

---

## Phase 1 — Robotic Manipulation (Arms)

### Collaborative Robot Arms (Evaluation Units)
- 6-axis cobots (food-safe compatible)  
  ~$25k – $80k per arm
- Force–torque sensing end effectors  
  ~$3k – $15k
- Quick-change tool heads  
  ~$1k – $8k

### Targets
- Safe human proximity
- Sub-mm repeatability
- Gentle grip force control

**R&D Value:**  
Establishes feasibility of automated planting and harvesting.

---

## Phase 2 — End Effectors & Tooling (Critical)

### Handling Tools
- Vacuum grippers (adjustable pressure)
- Soft-touch mechanical grippers
- Tray edge clamps
- Seed dispensing tools

**~$1k – $10k per tool class**

### Failure Modes Addressed
- Leaf damage
- Root disruption
- Tray deformation

**R&D Value:**  
This is where most automation projects quietly fail.

---

## Phase 3 — Transport Systems (Horizontal & Vertical)

### Automated Transport
- AGVs / AMRs (industrial grade)  
  ~$20k – $100k per unit
- Conveyor systems (modular, food-safe)  
  ~$5k – $50k
- Vertical lifts / elevators (tray-rated)  
  ~$10k – $80k

**Design Principle:**  
Movement must degrade gracefully, not catastrophically.

**R&D Value:**  
Prevents a single jam from halting production.

---

## Phase 4 — Machine Vision & Sensing (Hardware Only)

*(Logic lives in SP-007)*

### Vision Hardware
- Industrial RGB cameras  
  ~$500 – $5k per unit
- Depth cameras / stereo vision  
  ~$1k – $8k
- Controlled lighting for vision zones  
  ~$500 – $3k

**R&D Value:**  
Enables gentle handling and health assessment without guesswork.

---

## Phase 5 — Safety, Interlocks & Human Override

### Safety Systems
- Light curtains
- Emergency stop networks
- Zone isolation switches
- Manual override interfaces

**~$2k – $15k**

**R&D Value:**  
Ensures robots fail safe, not fast.

---

## Phase 6 — Integration & Maintainability

### Infrastructure
- Modular mounting frames
- Cable management systems
- Washdown-rated enclosures
- Quick-disconnect power/data

**~$2k – $12k per robotic zone**

**R&D Value:**  
Automation that can’t be serviced becomes downtime.

---

## Phase X — Reference Only  
### Instant Full-Scale Build-Out @ Current Market Prices (Non-Binding)

> This phase represents a hypothetical, immediate full-scale automation deployment using current market pricing.  
> It is not part of Phases 0–6 and does not represent planned expenditure.  
> Included to anchor realism and support future ARGENT-based reinvestment modeling.

- ~20,000 trays per floor (~400,000 trays)
- High-throughput microgreens operation
- Mixed human–robot workflows
- Redundancy prioritized over minimum robot count
- Conservative cycle times to protect crops

### Why SP-006 Is a Line in the Sand
Bad automation:
- damages crops
- hides errors
- creates fragile dependencies

SP-006 ensures machines earn their place.
