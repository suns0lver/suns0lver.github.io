# EBOPFS  
## Earth-Based Organic Permaculture Farm Systems

### Domain Purpose
EBOPFS defines a family of vertically integrated, closed-loop farming systems designed to deliver:
- Continuous organic food production
- Extreme resource efficiency
- Full operational observability
- Scalable, repeatable deployment across sites

This domain prioritizes **truthful systems design** over aspirational marketing.  
Every project is decomposed, measurable, and auditable.

---

## What EBOPFS Is (and Is Not)

### EBOPFS Is
- A modular infrastructure framework for food security
- A convergence of biology, engineering, and automation
- A system designed to fail safely and recover gracefully
- Documentation that doubles as a build plan

### EBOPFS Is Not
- A single farm
- A monolithic build
- An off-grid fantasy on day one
- A black-box automation experiment

---

## Domain Structure

EBOPFS is organized as a **series of projects**, each decomposed into **ten subprojects (SPs)** with explicit scope boundaries.

Each project:
- Can be built independently
- Has its own R&D phases
- Includes an alternate **“Instant Build-Out @ Current Market Prices”** reference path
- Is readable by humans *and* agents (ARGENT-compatible)

## Active Projects

### Project0001.A — Closed Growing Environment (Microgreens Tower)

**Purpose:**  
Design and validate a fully automated, closed vertical growing environment optimized for dense microgreens production.

**Status:**  
R&D architecture complete · All SPs decomposed and cost-anchored

#### Subprojects
1. **SP-001** — Structural & Spatial Architecture  
2. **SP-002** — Grow Rack & Tray Systems  
3. **SP-003** — Lighting Systems & Spectral Control  
4. **SP-004** — Irrigation & Nutrient Delivery  
5. **SP-005** — Climate, Airflow & CO₂ Control  
6. **SP-006** — Robotics & Automation Hardware  
7. **SP-007** — Monitoring, AI & Control Systems  
8. **SP-008** — Processing, Packaging & Traceability  
9. **SP-009** — Energy & Water Integration  
10. **SP-010** — Logistics & Output Flow  

Each SP includes:
- Validation-first R&D phases
- Explicit non-goals
- Failure modes
- Contribution surfaces
- A non-binding instant build-out cost reference

---

## Financial Honesty Doctrine

All EBOPFS projects follow a strict separation:

### R&D Phases
- Small-scale
- Measured
- Reversible
- Focused on learning and validation

### Instant Build-Out Reference (Phase X)
- Reflects **current market reality**
- Clearly labeled non-binding
- Included to:
  - Anchor expectations
  - Enable reinvestment modeling
  - Support ARGENT-based capital allocation
- Not a commitment or roadmap

No blended fantasy numbers.  
No pretending skyscrapers cost $10k.

---

## Contribution Philosophy

EBOPFS welcomes contribution across multiple axes:

- Engineering expertise
- Equipment evaluation units
- Research partnerships
- Targeted financial support
- Process and safety review

Contributions are **earmarked**, **traceable**, and **bounded** to specific SPs.

No pooled ambiguity.

---

## Interfaces With Other Domains

EBOPFS is designed to interlock cleanly with:
- **Energy systems** (resilience, not dependence)
- **Manufacturing** (future in-house hardware)
- **Automation & reasoning systems** (ARGENT)
- **Logistics & distribution networks**
- **Community food access initiatives**

Each interface is explicit to prevent scope bleed.

---

## Guiding Principles

- Measure before optimizing
- Automate only what is understood
- Prefer observability over cleverness
- Design for cold climates and hard failures
- Keep humans sovereign in the loop
- Document so the system can be rebuilt without its authors

---

## Current State

- ✅ Project0001.A fully decomposed
- ✅ All SPs documented and cost-anchored
- ✅ Domain ready for public review
- ⏳ Additional EBOPFS projects forthcoming

---

## Next Steps

- Publish EBOPFS domain publicly
- Link Project0001.A from landing page
- Open contribution channels
- Begin validation-phase execution
- Derive future EBOPFS projects from lessons learned

---

### Closing Note
EBOPFS is not a pitch.  
It is an instruction set for growing food without lying to ourselves.

If this document survives scrutiny, the system will survive reality.
