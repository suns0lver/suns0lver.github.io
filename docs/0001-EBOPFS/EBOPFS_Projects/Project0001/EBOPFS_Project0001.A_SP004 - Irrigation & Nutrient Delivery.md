## SP-004 — Irrigation & Nutrient Delivery

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP-004 exists to benchmark and validate precision nutrient delivery systems capable of:
- Uniform distribution at scale
- Closed-loop recovery
- Chemical stability over time
- Biological safety (no pathogen amplification)

We prioritize repeatability, observability, and clean failure modes over novelty.

## Phase 0 — Nutrient & Crop Chemistry Definition

### Chemistry & Crop Analysis
- Crop-specific nutrient uptake profiles (microgreens)
- EC / pH targets by growth phase
- Ion antagonism and precipitation risk mapping
- Water source analysis (baseline chemistry)

**~$3k – $15k**

**R&D Value:**  
Prevents “mystery deficiencies” and silent yield loss.

## Phase 1 — Water Source, Storage & Treatment

### Water Intake & Conditioning
- Food-grade storage tanks (HDPE / stainless)  
  ~$1k – $10k per tank
- Sediment filtration (multi-stage)  
  ~$500 – $5k
- Carbon filtration  
  ~$500 – $5k
- UV sterilization (flow-through)  
  ~$2k – $15k
- Optional RO system (research only)  
  ~$3k – $25k

**R&D Value:**  
Defines what water enters the system — everything else depends on this.

---

## Phase 2 — Nutrient Mixing & Dosing (Precision Core)

### Mixing Infrastructure
- Food-grade mixing tanks with agitation  
  ~$1k – $8k
- Variable-speed mixers  
  ~$500 – $3k

  ~$300 – $2k per channel
- Redundant dosing channels (fail-safe design)
- Calibration standards and reagents  
  ~$500 – $3k

**R&D Value:**  
Turns nutrient recipes into controlled variables, not guesses.

---

## Phase 3 — Distribution Architecture (NFT / Drip / Hybrid)

### Delivery Hardware
- Food-grade tubing (PVC-free preferred)
- Manifolds with individual flow control
- Pressure-regulated emitters
- Flow meters (per zone / per rack)

**~$2k – $15k per rack zone**

**Design Principle:**  
Distribution must be measurable and isolatable per zone.

**R&D Value:**  
Prevents one clogged line from corrupting an entire dataset.

---

## Phase 4 — Drainage, Recovery & Closed-Loop Control

### Recovery Systems
- Sloped drainage channels
- Return manifolds
- Sump tanks (segregated by zone)
- Inline debris filters

**~$2k – $12k**

### Monitoring
- Inline EC sensors  
  ~$300 – $2k per node
- Inline pH sensors  
  ~$300 – $2k per node
- Temperature sensors  
  ~$50 – $300 per node

**R&D Value:**  
Enables nutrient reuse without lying to yourself.

## Phase 5 — Biosecurity & Cleaning (Critical)

### Sanitation Infrastructure
- CIP (Clean-In-Place) loop capability
- Flush valves per zone
- Chemical-free sanitation options (UV / heat)
- Chemical sanitation (research-controlled only)

**~$2k – $20k**

### Failure Modes Addressed
- Biofilm accumulation
- Pathogen amplification
- Nutrient drift over time

## Phase 6 — Instrumentation & Verification

### Measurement & Logging
- Portable EC / pH meters (lab-grade)  
  ~$300 – $2k
- Data logging hardware  
  ~$500 – $5k
- Sample ports (pre / post delivery)

**R&D Value:**  
Separates plant stress from nutrient error.

## Phase X — Reference Only  
### Instant Full-Scale Build-Out @ Current Market Prices (Non-Binding)

> This phase represents a hypothetical, immediate full-scale irrigation and nutrient deployment using current market pricing.  
> It is not part of Phases 0–6 and does not represent planned expenditure.  
> Included to anchor realism and support future ARGENT-based reinvestment modeling.

### Why SP-004 Is Non-Optional
If nutrients drift:
- data is corrupted
- yields lie
- automation mislearns
- scale fails catastrophically

SP-004 is where biology meets engineering honesty.
