## SP-009 — Energy & Water Integration

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP-009 exists to benchmark best-in-class energy and water systems that:
- Reduce operating volatility
- Expose real load profiles
- Support graceful degradation
- Prioritize resilience over theoretical independence

This SP is about knowing the true cost of calories, not chasing off-grid fantasies on day one.

---

## Phase 0 — Load & Flow Characterization  
*(No hardware before truth)*

### Energy & Water Modeling
- Electrical load profiling (lighting, pumps, HVAC, robotics)
- Peak vs baseload separation
- Thermal load coupling analysis
- Water inflow / outflow accounting (by SP)

**~$3k – $15k**

**R&D Value:**  
Defines where energy and water actually go, not where we hope they go.

---

## Phase 1 — Electrical Intake, Distribution & Measurement

### Power Infrastructure
- Industrial electrical panels and breakers  
  ~$2k – $15k
- Power distribution units (PDUs)  
  ~$1k – $8k
- Surge protection and grounding systems  
  ~$1k – $6k

### Measurement & Monitoring
- Smart meters (per major subsystem)  
  ~$300 – $2k per node
- Power quality analyzers  
  ~$1k – $10k

**Design Principle:**  
If you can’t measure it, you can’t steward it.

**R&D Value:**  
Turns “energy efficiency” into data, not claims.

---

## Phase 2 — On-Site Generation (Benchmarking Only)

### Renewable Evaluation Units
- Solar PV arrays (modular test scale)  
  ~$5k – $50k
- Inverters (grid-tied + hybrid)  
  ~$2k – $15k
- Mounting and tracking hardware  
  ~$2k – $10k

**R&D Value:**  
Establishes realistic contribution fractions without overcommitting.

---

## Phase 3 — Energy Storage & Load Smoothing

### Storage Systems
- Battery storage modules (Li-ion / LFP evaluation)  
  ~$5k – $60k
- Battery management systems  
  ~$1k – $8k
- UPS systems for critical loads  
  ~$1k – $10k

### Targets
- Ride-through for outages
- Peak shaving
- Critical subsystem protection

**R&D Value:**  
Keeps crops alive when grids misbehave.

---

## Phase 4 — Thermal Energy Recovery & Reuse

### Heat Integration
- Heat exchangers (air-to-air, air-to-water)  
  ~$2k – $15k
- Waste heat capture from lighting and equipment
- Thermal storage (water tanks, phase-change materials)  
  ~$1k – $10k

**R&D Value:**  
Turns “waste” into a second resource stream.

---

## Phase 5 — Water Capture, Recycling & Accounting

### Water Systems
- Rainwater harvesting (roof capture, tanks)  
  ~$2k – $20k
- Greywater recovery (process water only)  
  ~$3k – $25k
- Flow meters (per loop)  
  ~$200 – $1k per node

**Design Principle:**  
Every liter is counted twice: in and out.

**R&D Value:**  
Prevents hidden water debt.

---

## Phase 6 — Treatment, Storage & Resilience

### Conditioning & Storage
- Food-grade water storage tanks  
  ~$1k – $10k
- UV / filtration (interface with SP-004)  
  ~$1k – $15k
- Freeze protection and insulation  
  ~$1k – $8k

**R&D Value:**  
Cold climates punish sloppy water design.

## Phase X — Reference Only  
### Instant Full-Scale Build-Out @ Current Market Prices (Non-Binding)

> This phase represents a hypothetical, immediate deployment of full-scale energy and water infrastructure using current market pricing.  
> It is not part of Phases 0–6 and does not represent planned expenditure.  
> Included to anchor realism and support future ARGENT-based reinvestment modeling.

### Assumptions

- Continuous, high-load operation (lighting + HVAC dominant)
- Grid-connected with resilience-first design
- On-site generation as supplement, not sole supply
- Cold-climate operation with freeze protection
- Water reuse prioritized but potable backup retained

### Why SP-009 Is the Quiet Decider
Bad energy design:
- inflates operating cost
- hides fragility
- punishes scale

Bad water design:
- collapses trust
- kills resilience
- invites regulatory pain

SP-009 ensures the tower lives within its means.
