# BBAWM · Project0001  
## Back-to-Basics Archaic Workshop — Metallurgy

### Project Purpose
BBAWM establishes a survivable, human-scale metallurgy stack capable of:
- Producing and repairing tools
- Controlling heat as a variable
- Studying alloys and failure modes honestly
- Preserving metallurgical knowledge across generations

This project prioritizes:
- Repeatability over vibes
- Safety over speed
- Understanding over hype
- Documentation over folklore

> Heat is a controllable variable, not a vibe.

## Decomposition Overview

Project0001 contains **10 subprojects (SP001–SP010)**, each independently contributable and bounded.

**Scope Doctrine**
- Human-scale metallurgy (no industrial fantasy)
- Controlled experimentation
- Failures are documented assets
- No dependency on fragile infrastructure

---

## SP001 — Philosophy, Layout & Flow

### Role
Defines how the metallurgy workshop thinks, moves, and stays safe.

### Scope
- Zone design (hot, warm, cold)
- Contamination control logic
- Material, tool, and human flow
- Safety doctrine and signage

### Clarifier
- Cold zones are contamination-free zones by policy, not convenience

---

## SP002 — Forge, Fire & Thermal Control

### Role
Establishes repeatable heat generation and controllable thermal behavior.

### Scope
- Solid fuel and gas forge infrastructure
- Bellows / airflow control
- Heat-zone mapping
- Fuel sourcing doctrine

### Clarifier
- Repeatability across fuel batches is tracked as a first-order variable

---

## SP003 — Anvils, Mass & Impact

### Role
Turns heat into work without destroying structure or humans.

### Scope
- Anvil systems and mounting
- Rebound measurement
- Striking ergonomics
- Fatigue and efficiency

### Clarifier
- Energy return and operator fatigue are tracked as paired metrics

---

## SP004 — Shaping, Forming & Mechanical Advantage

### Role
Extends shaping capability without losing metallurgical truth.

### Scope
- Tongs, fullers, swages
- Mechanical advantage systems
- Striking coordination
- Form control methods

### Clarifier
- Define when mechanical advantage should NOT be used to preserve grain and structure

---

## SP005 — Heat Treatment & Phase Control

### Role
Establishes phase behavior control for tool steel and foundational alloys.

### Scope
- Normalizing, quenching, tempering
- Quench media comparison
- Repeatable cycles
- Section-thickness doctrine

### Clarifier
- Cooling rate logged relative to section thickness

---

## SP006 — Casting & Mold Systems

### Role
Enables controlled casting for components while preserving domain boundaries.

### Scope
- Small-scale casting
- Mold making
- Casting defects and mitigation
- Component-level applications

### Clarifier
- Casting complements forging; it does not replace it

---

## SP007 — Finishing, Grinding & Edge Geometry

### Role
Defines finishing as structural integrity, not cosmetics.

### Scope
- Grinding discipline
- Heat management at edges
- Edge geometry and intended behavior
- Honing and polishing doctrine

### Clarifier
- Edge geometry documented relative to intended failure mode

---

## SP008 — Alloy Research & Experimentation

### Role
Creates disciplined, non-hype alloy exploration.

### Scope
- Variable isolation
- Microstructure observation (where possible)
- Comparative tests
- Documentation of recipes and outcomes

### Clarifier
- Single-variable changes per experiment are enforced

---

## SP009 — Failure Analysis & Testing

### Role
Turns breakage into understanding.

### Scope
- Destructive testing protocols
- Non-destructive testing protocols
- Failure-mode classification
- Limits discovery

### Clarifier
- A test that does not destroy something must explicitly state:
  - why it is non-destructive
  - where destruction begins
  - what limits are being measured or inferred

---

## SP010 — Storage, Flow & Memory

### Role
Preserves metallurgical assets and prevents contamination across time.

### Scope
- Stock separation (trusted vs experimental)
- Tool and die storage
- Material traceability
- Knowledge archives

### Clarifier
- Experimental stock and trusted stock are separated visually and physically

---

## Cross-Domain Hooks
BBAWM is designed to integrate cleanly with:
- BBAW-C tool demand and repair continuity
- EBOPFS maintenance independence
- MIFF future scale-up (explicitly deferred)
- LOAMS materials research
- Energy systems via efficiency doctrine (no dependency)

---

## Status
**Current:** Decomposition complete  
**Next Gate:** SP-level wishlists, validation phases, and publish structure

---

### Closing Note
Buying metal makes you a consumer.  
Understanding metal makes you sovereign.

BBAWM exists to make the workshop permanent.
