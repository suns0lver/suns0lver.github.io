## SP006 — Casting & Mold Systems

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP006 treats **molten metal as a fluid with memory**, governed by safety,
turbulence control, and solidification logic.

Casting is not spectacle. It is disciplined invitation.

> This SP treats molten metal as a fluid with memory, not a spectacle.

---

## Phase 0 — Casting Doctrine & Safety Envelope  
*(Safety before heat)*

### Core Risks
- Molten metal splash and spatter
- Steam explosions
- Toxic fumes
- Mold failure

### Safety Doctrine
- Steam explosion risk explicitly tied to **moisture sources** (tools, molds, environment)
- No pour proceeds without dry-path verification
- Escape paths kept clear and unblocked

**R&D Value:**  
Most casting accidents are moisture, not metal.

---

## Phase 1 — Melting Furnaces (Small → Medium Scale)

### Systems
- Fuel-fired furnaces
- Electric resistance furnaces (where appropriate)
- Crucible-compatible designs

### Melt Doctrine
- Crucible preheat and seasoning protocols documented
- Melt temperature logged relative to alloy and crucible material

**Price Anchor:**  
- $3k – $40k per melting furnace system

**R&D Value:**  
Cold crucibles contaminate truth.

---

## Phase 2 — Crucibles, Handling & Pour Control

### Handling Systems
- Lifting tongs
- Shank tools
- Pouring rings

### Control Variables
- Pour height treated as a controlled variable
- Stream stability documented and tuned
- Turbulence minimized by geometry, not speed

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1k – $15k per handling system

**R&D Value:**  
Turbulence is invisible until it becomes a defect.

---

## Phase 3 — Sand Casting Systems

### Systems
- Green sand
- Oil-bonded sand
- Simple flask systems

### Process Control
- Sand moisture content logged per batch
- Compaction pressure documented
- Venting paths verified

**Price Anchor:**  
- $2k – $25k per sand casting setup

**R&D Value:**  
Sand lies quietly until metal tells the truth.

---

## Phase 4 — Investment & Lost-Pattern Casting

### Systems
- Wax patterns
- Shell building
- Burnout kilns

### Burnout Doctrine
- Burnout profiles documented relative to shell thickness
- Residual ash risk assessed before pour

**Price Anchor:**  
- $3k – $30k per investment casting setup

**R&D Value:**  
Incomplete burnout becomes permanent inclusion.

---

## Phase 5 — Mold Making & Pattern Fabrication

### Scope
- Wood patterns
- Metal patterns
- Printed sacrificial patterns (where applicable)

### Pattern Doctrine
- Pattern wear tracked over reuse cycles
- Geometry drift documented

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1k – $20k per pattern system

**R&D Value:**  
Patterns decay slowly and ruin casts quickly.

---

## Phase 6 — Cooling, Shakeout & Cleanup

### Processes
- Controlled cooling
- Shakeout procedures
- Gating and riser removal

### Control Variables
- Cooling rate recorded relative to section thickness and alloy
- Premature handling explicitly prohibited

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1k – $12k per cooling and cleanup zone

**R&D Value:**  
Cooling is metallurgy, not waiting.

---

## Phase 7 — Inspection, Defect Analysis & Iteration  
*(Learning before repetition)*

### Inspection
- Visual inspection
- Dimensional checks
- Defect mapping

### Analysis Doctrine
- Every defect is **classified before it is corrected**
- Defects traced to process variables, not assumptions

**Price Anchor:**  
- $500 – $8k per inspection system

**R&D Value:**  
Unclassified defects become recurring mysteries.

---

## Phase X — Reference Only  
### Instant Foundry Capability @ Current Market Prices (Non-Binding)

> This phase represents a hypothetical, immediate deployment of complete
> casting and mold-making capability using current market pricing.
> It is not part of Phases 0–7 and does not represent planned expenditure.
> Included to anchor realism and support future ARGENT-based reinvestment modeling.

### Assumptions
- Small to medium casting scale
- Multiple alloy capability
- Apprentice + master redundancy
- Immediate readiness prioritized over slow learning curves

---

### Order-of-Magnitude Cost Reference

#### Melting & Furnace Infrastructure
➡️ **$800k – $2.2M**

#### Crucibles, Handling & Pour Control
➡️ **$500k – $1.3M**

#### Mold Making & Pattern Systems
➡️ **$700k – $2.0M**

#### Inspection, Cleanup & Documentation
➡️ **$300k – $700k**

---

### Reference Total (SP006 Only)
> **~$2.3M – $6.2M USD**

This excludes:
- Forge and fire systems
- Impact and shaping systems
- Heat treatment programs
- Advanced alloy research

---

## Contribution Modes (Explicit)
- Foundry furnaces and crucibles
- Mold and pattern materials
- Safety systems and PPE
- Inspection and QA tooling
- Funding earmarked **SP006 only**

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Industrial-scale foundries
- Continuous casting
- Automated production lines
- Exotic aerospace alloys

---

## Status
**Current:** Casting doctrine defined and cost-anchored  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Safety envelope enforced  
✔ Flow controlled  
✔ Defects understood

### Why SP006 Matters
Forging forces metal to obey.

Casting asks metal to choose.

SP006 teaches you how to listen.
