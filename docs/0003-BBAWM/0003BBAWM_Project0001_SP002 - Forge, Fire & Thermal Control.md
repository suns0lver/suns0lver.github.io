## SP002 — Forge, Fire & Thermal Control

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP002 establishes **heat as a controllable, inspectable variable**.

This SP exists to:
- Generate repeatable thermal ranges
- Control atmosphere and airflow
- Measure heat truthfully
- Preserve heat capability under failure conditions

> Fire here is not romantic — it’s instrumented.  
> This SP is heat generation, not deformation.

## Phase 0 — Thermal Range Definition & Fire Doctrine  
*(Define heat before building fire)*

### Foundational Analysis
- Target thermal ranges by process
- Transient vs steady-state temperature behavior documented separately
- Time-at-temperature requirements
- Abort thresholds and failure indicators

**R&D Value:**  
Prevents mistaking peak heat for usable heat.

---

## Phase 1 — Solid Fuel Forge Systems

### Systems
- Charcoal forges
- Coke forges
- Solid-fuel air delivery (manual / mechanical)

### Performance Variables
- Charcoal sizing and screening documented as a performance variable
- Fuel density and burn rate tracked
- Ash and clinker management procedures defined

**Price Anchor:**  
- $2k – $20k per solid-fuel forge setup

**R&D Value:**  
Fuel geometry shapes heat more than flame color.

---

## Phase 2 — Gas Forge Systems (Evaluation & Precision Control)

### Systems
- Propane and natural gas forges
- Burner designs
- Pressure regulation and safety valves

### Evaluation Criteria
- Flame stability under low-pressure conditions
- Startup repeatability
- Shutdown predictability

**Price Anchor:**  
- $3k – $30k per gas forge system

**R&D Value:**  
Precision heat is useless if it vanishes under constraint.

---

## Phase 3 — Refractory Science & Heat Retention

### Materials
- Firebrick
- Castable refractories
- Insulating liners

### Construction Doctrine
- Refractory dry-out and cure schedules documented explicitly
- Thermal cycling limits recorded
- Failure modes logged

**Price Anchor:**  
- $2k – $25k per refractory system

**R&D Value:**  
Most forge failures begin silently inside the walls.

---

## Phase 4 — Airflow, Draft & Atmosphere Control

### Controls
- Manual dampers
- Draft tuning
- Oxidizing vs reducing atmosphere management

### Doctrine
- Atmosphere transitions logged relative to material and heat stage
- No uncontrolled air paths allowed

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1k – $15k per airflow control system

**R&D Value:**  
Steel reacts to air as much as it reacts to heat.

---

## Phase 5 — Temperature Measurement & Feedback

### Measurement Systems
- Thermocouples
- Optical pyrometers
- Color-reference charts (human verification)

### Measurement Doctrine
- Sensor placement documented
- Measurement lag recorded and compensated

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1k – $12k per measurement system

**R&D Value:**  
Sensors tell the truth only when questioned correctly.

---

## Phase 6 — Fuel Handling, Storage & Safety

### Scope
- Fuel storage zones
- Moisture control
- Ignition prevention
- Spill and fire mitigation

### Safety Controls
- Fuel moisture content tracked where applicable
- Separation between active fuel and reserve stock

**Price Anchor:**  
- $2k – $20k per fuel handling zone

**R&D Value:**  
Uncontrolled fuel corrupts controlled heat.

---

## Phase 7 — Redundancy, Repair & Resilience

### Resilience Strategy
- Backup forge capability
- Spare refractory materials
- Redundant airflow paths
- Repair-first design

> Redundancy is designed to preserve heat capability, not comfort.

**Price Anchor:**  
- $2k – $18k per redundancy tier

**R&D Value:**  
A forge that cannot be repaired is temporary.

---

## Phase X — Reference Only  
### Instant Precision-Heat Build-Out @ Current Market Prices (Non-Binding)

> This phase represents a hypothetical, immediate deployment of fully
> instrumented forge and thermal-control capability using current market pricing.
> It is not part of Phases 0–7 and does not represent planned expenditure.
> Included to anchor realism and support future ARGENT-based reinvestment modeling.

### Assumptions
- Multiple forge bays
- Mixed solid-fuel and gas capability
- Apprentice + master redundancy
- Conservative safety margins
- Immediate readiness prioritized over incremental tuning

### Why SP002 Is the Heartbeat
If heat lies, steel lies.

SP002 makes lying expensive.
