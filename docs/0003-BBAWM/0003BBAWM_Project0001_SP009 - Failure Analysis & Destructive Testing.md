## SP009 — Failure Analysis & Destructive Testing

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP009 exists to **intentionally destroy things so that nothing fails by surprise later**.

If SP008 asks *“what if?”*, SP009 answers *“here’s the cost.”*

Destruction is not spectacle. It is the price of credibility.

---

## Phase 0 — Failure Doctrine & Test Ethics  
*(Ethics before force)*

### Core Principles
- Every destructive test must state **why full destruction is required**
- Tests that do **not** destroy something must explicitly define:
  - What is being preserved
  - Where destruction would have occurred
  - Why that boundary was respected

### Doctrine
- Performative destruction is forbidden
- Tests are designed to reveal limits, not impress observers

**R&D Value:**  
Destruction without intent teaches nothing.

---

## Phase 1 — Mechanical Destruction Systems  
*(Simple forces before exotic ones)*

### Systems
- Static load frames
- Press-based destruction rigs
- Lever and impact-based test setups

### Control Variables
- Load magnitude
- Load application rate documented alongside maximum load
- Boundary conditions logged

**Price Anchor:**  
- $2k – $30k per destruction system

**R&D Value:**  
How force is applied matters as much as how much.

---

## Phase 2 — Fracture Initiation & Propagation Studies  
*(Crack birth before crack life)*

### Studies
- Notch testing
- Pre-cracked samples
- Controlled flaw introduction

### Doctrine
- Pre-crack geometry standardized unless geometry itself is the variable
- Crack initiation and propagation recorded separately

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1k – $20k per fracture study setup

**R&D Value:**  
Cracks have histories, not just endings.

---

## Phase 3 — Fatigue & Cyclic Load Testing  
*(Repetition before drama)*

### Tests
- Repeated load cycling
- Variable amplitude fatigue
- Long-duration endurance tests

### Control Doctrine
- Cycle termination criteria documented
  (failure, deformation threshold, or time cap)
- Environmental conditions logged during testing

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1k – $25k per fatigue testing system

**R&D Value:**  
Most failures arrive tired, not shocked.

---

## Phase 4 — Thermal Shock & Environmental Abuse  
*(Environment before blame)*

### Stressors
- Rapid heating and cooling
- Moisture exposure
- Corrosive or abrasive environments

### Documentation
- Environmental conditions logged as **ranges**, not single values
- Transition rates recorded

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1k – $15k per environmental abuse setup

**R&D Value:**  
Reality fluctuates. Tests must too.

---

## Phase 5 — Post-Failure Forensics  
*(Evidence before explanation)*

### Analysis
- Fracture surface inspection
- Deformation mapping
- Residual stress indicators

### Handling Doctrine
- Fracture surfaces protected immediately post-failure
- Handling damage explicitly avoided and logged if unavoidable

**Price Anchor:**  
- $500 – $10k per forensic analysis kit

**R&D Value:**  
Destroyed evidence destroys learning.

---

## Phase 6 — Comparative Benchmarking  
*(Context before claims)*

### Benchmarks
- Commercial tools
- Historical references
- Known-failure exemplars

### Documentation
- Benchmark tools documented with known manufacturing shortcuts or constraints
- Comparisons framed as learning, not superiority

**Price Anchor:**  
- $500 – $12k per benchmarking system

**R&D Value:**  
Without context, comparison becomes propaganda.

---

## Phase 7 — Failure Archive & Knowledge Encoding  
*(Memory before forgetting)*

### Archive Rules
- All failures logged
- Causes hypothesized
- Preventative insights encoded

> A failure without a recorded lesson is a second failure.

**Price Anchor:**  
- $300 – $8k per archival system

**R&D Value:**  
Memory turns destruction into progress.

---

## Phase X — Reference Only  
### Instant Destructive Testing Capability @ Current Market Prices (Non-Binding)

> This phase represents a hypothetical, immediate deployment of comprehensive
> destructive and failure-testing capability using current market pricing.
> It is not part of Phases 0–7 and does not represent planned expenditure.
> Included to anchor realism and support future ARGENT-based reinvestment modeling.

### Assumptions
- Workshop-scale testing only
- Repeatable, instrumented setups
- Apprentice + master redundancy
- Immediate readiness prioritized over incremental buildout

---

### Order-of-Magnitude Cost Reference

#### Mechanical & Fatigue Test Infrastructure
➡️ **$700k – $2.0M**

#### Environmental & Thermal Abuse Systems
➡️ **$500k – $1.4M**

#### Forensics, Benchmarking & Archival Systems
➡️ **$400k – $1.0M**

---

### Reference Total (SP009 Only)
> **~$1.6M – $4.4M USD**

This excludes:
- Production QA
- Certification testing
- Mass statistical validation
- Safety guarantees

---

## Contribution Modes (Explicit)
- Test rigs and fixtures
- Measurement and logging equipment
- Failure analysis expertise
- Documentation and archival tooling
- Funding earmarked **SP009 only**

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Certification or compliance testing
- Production quality assurance
- Statistical lifetime guarantees
- Marketing claims

---

## Status
**Current:** Failure doctrine defined and cost-anchored  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Limits revealed  
✔ Causes understood  
✔ Lessons preserved

### Why SP009 Matters
Anyone can show what works once.

SP009 proves what survives reality.
