## SP003 — Anvils, Mass & Impact Control

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP003 governs **how force is received, stored, and returned**.

An anvil is not a tool — it is **stored momentum**.
This SP ensures impact energy is conserved, directed, and survivable for both steel and smith.

> This SP is force reception, not force creation.

---

## Phase 0 — Impact Doctrine & Mass Coupling  
*(Define force before striking)*

### Foundational Concepts
- Vertical rebound vs horizontal energy bleed
- Energy loss paths (floor, stand, soil)
- Human fatigue as a measurable output

> Horizontal energy bleed and vertical rebound are documented separately.

**R&D Value:**  
If energy disappears sideways, it is never recovered in steel.

---

## Phase 1 — Primary Anvil Systems

### Scope
- Baseline “truth” anvil selection
- Mass-to-work ratio definition
- Face geometry and edge profiles

### Verification
- Face hardness verified relative to intended hammer materials
- Rebound consistency tested across face regions

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1k – $20k per primary anvil system

**R&D Value:**  
A mismatched anvil lies quietly until steel pays the price.

---

## Phase 2 — Secondary & Specialized Anvils

### Systems
- Pattern anvils
- Horn variants
- Stake anvils
- Specialty mass forms

### Evaluation Doctrine
- Specialized anvils evaluated for **teaching value**, not just utility
- Redundancy avoided unless purpose is explicit

**Price Anchor:**  
- $500 – $15k per specialized anvil

**R&D Value:**  
Accumulation without intent becomes clutter, not capability.

---

## Phase 3 — Anvil Mounting & Foundation Systems

### Mounting Strategies
- Wood blocks
- Sand-filled bases
- Composite damping systems
- Direct ground coupling

### Monitoring
- Mount compression over time measured and logged
- Height drift and tilt checked periodically

**Price Anchor:**  
- $300 – $10k per mounting system

**R&D Value:**  
Settling mounts steal energy one strike at a time.

---

## Phase 4 — Swage Blocks & Auxiliary Forming Mass

### Scope
- Swage blocks
- Striking plates
- Supplemental mass stations

### Alignment Doctrine
- Mass alignment verified to prevent lateral energy deflection
- Contact surfaces trued before use

**Price Anchor:**  
- $500 – $25k per forming mass station

**R&D Value:**  
Misaligned mass corrupts force before it reaches the work.

---

## Phase 5 — Vibration, Noise & Ergonomics Control

### Controls
- Isolation layers
- Damping materials
- Operator stance geometry

### Evaluation Doctrine
- Noise reduction evaluated relative to **energy conservation**, not silence
- Over-damping avoided

**Price Anchor:**  
- $300 – $8k per control system

**R&D Value:**  
Quiet that steals rebound is expensive quiet.

---

## Phase 6 — Impact Testing & Rebound Verification

### Testing Protocols
- Drop-ball rebound tests
- Hammer rebound tests
- Thermal state variation tests

### Verification
- Rebound tests repeated across temperature ranges
- Results logged and compared longitudinally

**Price Anchor:**  
- $200 – $5k per testing setup

**R&D Value:**  
Cold anvils and warm anvils do not tell the same truth.

---

## Phase 7 — Documentation, Patterning & Legacy Capture

### Outputs
- Anvil profiles
- Mounting schematics
- Rebound logs
- Wear progression records

**Price Anchor:**  
- $200 – $3k per documentation system

**R&D Value:**  
Anvils outlive builders. Knowledge must outlive both.

---

## Phase X — Reference Only  
### Instant Full-Scale Impact Infrastructure @ Current Market Prices (Non-Binding)

> This phase represents a hypothetical, immediate deployment of complete anvil,
> mounting, and impact-control infrastructure using current market pricing.
> It is not part of Phases 0–7 and does not represent planned expenditure.
> Included to anchor realism and support future ARGENT-based reinvestment modeling.

### Assumptions
- Multiple striking stations
- Apprentice + master redundancy
- Indoor and outdoor anvils
- Immediate readiness prioritized over incremental mass acquisition

### Order-of-Magnitude Cost Reference

#### Primary & Specialized Anvil Inventory
➡️ **$700k – $2.0M**

#### Mounting, Foundations & Damping Systems
➡️ **$500k – $1.4M**

#### Swage Blocks & Auxiliary Forming Mass
➡️ **$600k – $1.8M**

#### Testing & Documentation Infrastructure
➡️ **$250k – $600k**

---

### Reference Total (SP003 Only)
> **~$2.05M – $5.8M USD**

This excludes:
- Forge and fire systems
- Shaping and deformation tooling
- Heat-treatment doctrine
- Casting infrastructure

---

## Contribution Modes (Explicit)
- Anvils and forming mass
- Mounting and foundation materials
- Impact testing equipment
- Documentation systems
- Funding earmarked **SP003 only**

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Fire generation
- Metal deformation systems
- Heat treatment
- Casting or molding

---

## Status
**Current:** Impact reception doctrine defined and cost-anchored  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Energy conserved  
✔ Fatigue minimized  
✔ Force made honest

### Why SP003 Matters
Bad anvils make bad steel and broken smiths.

SP003 makes every strike count.
