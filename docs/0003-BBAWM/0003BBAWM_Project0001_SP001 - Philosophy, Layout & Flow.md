## SP001 — Philosophy, Layout & Flow

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP001 exists to **impose order on fire**.

This SP establishes the spatial, procedural, and cultural constraints that make
all downstream metallurgy possible without injury, contamination, or chaos.

Before steel is heated, the workshop itself must be correct.

> This SP is order before power.

---

## Phase 0 — Doctrine, Zoning & Flow Mapping  
*(Thought before equipment)*

### Conceptual Assets
- Explicit hot, warm, and cold zones
- Human, material, and tool flow paths
- Contamination boundaries
- Emergency access geometry

> Zones are enforced **physically**, not just procedurally.

**R&D Value:**  
Paint and rules fail. Walls and geometry endure.

---

## Phase 1 — Spatial Infrastructure & Foundations  
*(Building before flame)*

### Scope
- Fire-rated floors and walls
- Non-combustible structural materials
- Drainage and slag management
- Anchor points for future systems

### Structural Doctrine
- Thermal expansion allowances documented at all anchor points
- No rigid constraint across hot/cold interfaces

**Price Anchor:**  
- $25k – $250k per forge bay (structure only)

**R&D Value:**  
Structures that fight heat will crack trust before they crack concrete.

---

## Phase 2 — Ventilation, Exhaust & Airflow Control  
*(Air before heat)*

### Systems
- Passive exhaust stacks
- Active extraction (non-electrical where possible)
- Cross-flow ventilation

### Safety Doctrine
- Airflow designed to **fail safe toward exhaust**, not recirculation
- Smoke paths visible and verifiable

**Price Anchor:**  
- $10k – $150k per airflow system

**R&D Value:**  
If you can’t see the air, you don’t control the fire.

---

## Phase 3 — Lighting, Visibility & Situational Awareness  
*(Sight before strike)*

### Lighting Strategy
- Ambient shop lighting
- Forge-local illumination
- Shadow minimization

### Verification
- Lighting color temperature verified against steel color charts
- No glare zones at anvils or striking positions

**Price Anchor:**  
- $5k – $50k per lighting zone

**R&D Value:**  
Misreading color misreads temperature. That costs steel and skin.

---

## Phase 4 — Safety, Containment & Emergency Systems  
*(Emergency before confidence)*

### Systems
- Fire suppression
- Burn treatment stations
- Kill switches and blast clearance zones

> Emergency systems must be reachable **without crossing a hot zone**.

**Price Anchor:**  
- $10k – $100k per safety system cluster

**R&D Value:**  
Safety delayed by geometry is safety denied.

---

## Phase 5 — Material Staging & Thermal Transitions  
*(Flow before speed)*

### Staging Doctrine
- Cold stock → warm staging → hot work → controlled cooldown
- No cross-flow between incompatible thermal states

> Steel remembers how you move it.

**Price Anchor:**  
- $5k – $40k per staging lane

**R&D Value:**  
Thermal shock is often procedural, not accidental.

---

## Phase 6 — Documentation, Learning & Memory Walls  
*(Memory before mastery)*

### Systems
- Layout diagrams
- Process notes
- Incident and near-miss logs
- Revision histories

### Doctrine
- Failures are timestamped and cross-referenced to layout revisions

**Price Anchor:**  
- $2k – $20k per documentation system

**R&D Value:**  
A lesson not recorded will be relearned the hard way.

---

## Phase 7 — Ergonomics, Fatigue & Human Factors  
*(Humans before heroics)*

### Considerations
- Heat exposure limits
- Rest and rotation zones
- Tool reach and stance geometry

### Enforcement
- Heat exposure limits enforced **structurally**, not by willpower

**Price Anchor:**  
- $3k – $30k per ergonomic zone

**R&D Value:**  
Burnout and injury are system failures, not character flaws.

---

## Phase X — Reference Only  
### Instant Compliant Forge Build-Out @ Current Market Prices (Non-Binding)

> This phase represents a hypothetical, immediate construction of a fully
> compliant metallurgical workspace following SP001 doctrine.
> It is not part of Phases 0–7 and does not represent planned expenditure.
> Included to anchor realism and support future ARGENT-based reinvestment modeling.

### Assumptions
- Multiple forge bays
- Apprentice + master occupancy
- Conservative safety margins
- Immediate readiness prioritized over incremental retrofits

---

### Order-of-Magnitude Cost Reference

#### Structural & Fire-Rated Infrastructure
➡️ **$400k – $1.2M**

#### Ventilation & Airflow Systems
➡️ **$300k – $900k**

#### Lighting, Safety & Emergency Systems
➡️ **$250k – $700k**

#### Documentation & Ergonomic Infrastructure
➡️ **$150k – $400k**

---

### Reference Total (SP001 Only)
> **~$1.1M – $3.2M USD**

This excludes:
- Forge hardware
- Anvils and tooling
- Casting or heat-treatment systems
- Metallurgical processes themselves

---

## Contribution Modes (Explicit)
- Fire-rated construction materials
- Ventilation and airflow engineering
- Safety system design
- Documentation infrastructure
- Funding earmarked **SP001 only**

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Forge equipment
- Metallurgical tooling
- Alloy research
- Casting systems

---

## Status
**Current:** Forge philosophy, layout, and flow doctrine defined and cost-anchored  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Fire constrained by geometry  
✔ Humans protected by structure  
✔ Knowledge preserved

### Why SP001 Comes First
Fire does not forgive improvisation.

SP001 ensures no one has to rely on luck.
