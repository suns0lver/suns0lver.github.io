## SP005 — Heat Treatment & Phase Control

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP005 governs **phase behavior as a function of time, temperature, and restraint**.

Heat treatment is treated as disciplined metallurgy—not recipes, superstition,
or folklore. Steel does not become good by accident.

> This SP is phase control, not heat generation.

---

## Phase 0 — Phase Doctrine & Steel Literacy  
*(Understand structure before applying heat)*

### Foundational Concepts
- Austenite, martensite, pearlite, bainite
- Phase diagrams as directional guides, not exact maps
- Carbon content and alloying effects
- Critical temperature literacy

**R&D Value:**  
False precision destroys more steel than ignorance.

---

## Phase 1 — Normalizing & Thermal Equalization  
*(Forgiveness before violence)*

### Processes
- Single and multiple normalize cycles
- Thermal soak timing
- Grain refinement protocols

### Doctrine
- Normalize cycles logged relative to prior forging history
- Uneven heating treated as a process fault

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1k – $12k per normalize-capable setup

**R&D Value:**  
Forging history echoes here. Ignore it and steel remembers anyway.

---

## Phase 2 — Quenching Systems (Controlled Violence)

### Quench Media
- Water
- Brine
- Oil (various viscosities)
- Air (where applicable)

### Control Doctrine
- Quench severity matched to **section thickness**, not steel label
- Agitation patterns documented
- Abort criteria defined before quench

**Price Anchor:**  
- $2k – $20k per quenching system

**R&D Value:**  
Violence without restraint becomes fracture.

---

## Phase 3 — Tempering & Stress Relief  
*(Restraint and forgiveness)*

### Processes
- Single and multiple temper cycles
- Time-at-temperature control
- Stress relief protocols

### Verification
- Color-reference verification treated as secondary to logged temperature
- Temper results compared longitudinally

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1k – $15k per tempering system

**R&D Value:**  
Hardness without toughness is just delayed failure.

---

## Phase 4 — Measurement, Verification & QA

### Measurement Systems
- Hardness testing
- File tests (as comparative indicators)
- Dimensional stability checks

### QA Doctrine
- Measurement uncertainty documented alongside results
- Repeat tests favored over single readings

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1k – $10k per verification setup

**R&D Value:**  
Uncertainty acknowledged is uncertainty controlled.

---

## Phase 5 — Alloy-Specific Protocols

### Scope
- Known tool steels
- Simple carbon steels
- Salvaged or unknown alloys

### Safety Doctrine
- Unknown or mixed alloys default to conservative protocols
- Assumptions explicitly logged

**Price Anchor:**  
- $500 – $8k per alloy protocol set

**R&D Value:**  
Steel does not forgive guessing.

---

## Phase 6 — Failure Analysis & Feedback Loop

### Processes
- Break tests
- Bend tests
- Chisel and edge abuse tests

### Analysis Doctrine
- Failure analysis documents **what changed**, not just what broke
- Feedback loop tied to forging and heat steps

**Price Anchor:**  
- $500 – $6k per testing system

**R&D Value:**  
Breakage without understanding is just waste.

---

## Phase 7 — Documentation & Knowledge Transfer  
*(Memory before mastery)*

### Outputs
- Heat-treatment cards
- Phase schedules
- Steel histories
- Cross-links to forging and end use

### Doctrine
- Heat-treatment cards reference upstream forging and downstream use

**Price Anchor:**  
- $300 – $5k per documentation system

**R&D Value:**  
Repeatability lives in records, not reputation.

---

## Phase X — Reference Only  
### Instant Full-Scale Heat Treatment Capability @ Current Market Prices (Non-Binding)

> This phase represents a hypothetical, immediate deployment of complete
> heat-treatment and phase-control capability using current market pricing.
> It is not part of Phases 0–7 and does not represent planned expenditure.
> Included to anchor realism and support future ARGENT-based reinvestment modeling.

### Assumptions
- Multiple heat-treatment stations
- Calibrated temperature control
- Apprentice + master redundancy
- Immediate readiness prioritized over slow learning curves

---

### Order-of-Magnitude Cost Reference

#### Normalizing, Quenching & Tempering Infrastructure
➡️ **$800k – $2.2M**

#### Measurement, QA & Testing Systems
➡️ **$400k – $1.1M**

#### Documentation & Knowledge Systems
➡️ **$200k – $500k**

---

### Reference Total (SP005 Only)
> **~$1.4M – $3.8M USD**

This excludes:
- Forge and fire systems
- Shaping and forming infrastructure
- Casting systems
- Alloy research programs

---

## Contribution Modes (Explicit)
- Heat-treatment equipment
- Measurement and QA tooling
- Metallurgical expertise
- Documentation systems
- Funding earmarked **SP005 only**

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Fire generation
- Metal shaping
- Casting or molding
- Alloy experimentation

---

## Status
**Current:** Phase-control doctrine defined and cost-anchored  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Phases understood  
✔ Violence restrained  
✔ Results predictable

### Why SP005 Matters
Steel remembers everything you do to it.

SP005 decides whether that memory becomes strength.
