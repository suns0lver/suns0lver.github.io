## SP004 — Shaping, Forming & Mechanical Advantage

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP004 exists to **multiply human intent without surrendering feedback**.

Mechanical advantage is treated as controlled amplification, not free power.
Every system in this SP must preserve tactile truth, grain awareness, and
operator agency.

> This SP is force guidance, not force creation.

---

## Phase 0 — Force Path Doctrine  
*(Define leverage before multiplying it)*

### Foundational Principles
- Force paths are mapped from input to workpiece
- Loss, deflection, and amplification are documented
- Mechanical advantage thresholds beyond which tactile feedback becomes unreliable are explicitly defined

**R&D Value:**  
Leverage without feedback creates fast mistakes.

---

## Phase 1 — Hand Hammers & Precision Striking

### Systems
- Cross-peen, straight-peen, rounding, and specialty hammers
- Mass ranges appropriate to metallurgy-scale work

### Selection Doctrine
- Hammer mass matched to typical section thickness
- Balance prioritized over raw weight

**Price Anchor:**  
- $300 – $6,000 per hammer set

**R&D Value:**  
Precision begins at the wrist, not the press.

---

## Phase 2 — Tongs, Grips & Workpiece Control

### Scope
- Flat, round, box, and specialty tongs
- Temporary gripping aids
- Rotational and positional control tools

### Verification
- Grip security evaluated during heat, scale, and oxidation states
- Loss of control is treated as a system failure, not operator error

**Price Anchor:**  
- $500 – $10,000 per gripping system set

**R&D Value:**  
A secure grip preserves both steel and skin.

---

## Phase 3 — Top Tools, Bottom Tools & Guided Forming

### Systems
- Fullers
- Set tools
- Swages
- Form blocks

### Documentation
- Guided tools documented with intended deformation stage (early / mid / finish)
- Tool misuse scenarios explicitly noted

**Price Anchor:**  
- $500 – $20,000 per guided forming set

**R&D Value:**  
Guidance without intent becomes distortion.

---

## Phase 4 — Mechanical Presses (Human / Hybrid)

### Systems
- Fly presses
- Screw presses
- Lever-assisted presses

### Doctrine
- Press speed documented relative to grain flow preservation
- Press use forbidden where tactile feedback is required

**Price Anchor:**  
- $2,000 – $40,000 per press system

**R&D Value:**  
Slow force can be more destructive than fast force if misapplied.

---

## Phase 5 — Bending, Curving & Profile Control

### Scope
- Jigs and bending forms
- Radius blocks
- Curving fixtures

### Control Variables
- Springback compensation documented per material
- Form wear monitored and corrected

**Price Anchor:**  
- $500 – $15,000 per bending system

**R&D Value:**  
Repeatability lives in anticipation, not correction.

---

## Phase 6 — Alignment, Repeatability & Stops

### Systems
- Mechanical stops
- Gauges
- Alignment fixtures

### Validation
- Stops and gauges validated against thermal expansion effects
- Hot and cold alignment differences logged

**Price Anchor:**  
- $500 – $12,000 per alignment system

**R&D Value:**  
A stop that moves lies quietly.

---

## Phase 7 — Ergonomics, Fatigue & Safety  
*(Humans before machines)*

### Principles
- Neutral stance geometry
- Tool reach minimization
- Fatigue-aware workflow design

> Any system that reduces fatigue at the cost of feedback is rejected.

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1,000 – $15,000 per ergonomic optimization zone

**R&D Value:**  
Comfort that dulls perception is not safety.

---

## Phase X — Reference Only  
### Instant Full-Scale Shaping Infrastructure @ Current Market Prices (Non-Binding)

> This phase represents a hypothetical, immediate deployment of complete
> shaping, forming, and mechanical-advantage infrastructure using current market pricing.
> It is not part of Phases 0–7 and does not represent planned expenditure.
> Included to anchor realism and support future ARGENT-based reinvestment modeling.

### Assumptions
- Multiple forming stations
- Apprentice + master redundancy
- Human-scale presses only
- Immediate readiness prioritized over incremental tooling

---

### Order-of-Magnitude Cost Reference

#### Hand Tools, Gripping & Guided Forming
➡️ **$900k – $2.2M**

#### Presses & Mechanical Advantage Systems
➡️ **$1.0M – $2.8M**

#### Alignment, Stops & Ergonomic Infrastructure
➡️ **$600k – $1.5M**

---

### Reference Total (SP004 Only)
> **~$2.5M – $6.5M USD**

This excludes:
- Forge and fire systems
- Anvils and mass coupling
- Heat treatment doctrine
- Casting and molding infrastructure

---

## Contribution Modes (Explicit)
- Hand tools and guided forming systems
- Human-scale presses
- Alignment and repeatability fixtures
- Ergonomic optimization systems
- Funding earmarked **SP004 only**

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Fire generation
- Impact reception
- Heat treatment
- Casting or molding

---

## Status
**Current:** Shaping and mechanical-advantage doctrine defined and cost-anchored  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Feedback preserved  
✔ Force guided honestly  
✔ Repeatability achieved

### Why SP004 Matters
Power that ignores the hand destroys information.

SP004 ensures force still listens.
