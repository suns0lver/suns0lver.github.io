## SP008 — Alloy Research, Development & Experimentation

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP008 governs **disciplined alloy exploration under explicit ethical and safety guardrails**.

This SP exists to:
- Enable controlled curiosity
- Prevent hype-driven metallurgy
- Preserve learning even when results fail
- Make experimentation legible to collaborators

> This SP is exploration, not deployment.  
> Learning made legible.

---

## Phase 0 — Experimental Doctrine & Guardrails  
*(Ethics before curiosity)*

### Core Rules
- Single-variable change rule enforced unless explicitly justified
- No scaling beyond workshop limits
- No deployment claims of any kind
- All hazards reviewed before melt

**R&D Value:**  
Guardrails protect people and knowledge.

---

## Phase 1 — Baseline Alloy Library (Controls)  
*(Controls before novelty)*

### Baselines
- Simple carbon steels
- Known tool steels
- Common non-ferrous reference alloys

### Control Doctrine
- Baseline samples periodically re-run to detect drift in process or tooling
- Control results logged alongside experiments

**Price Anchor:**  
- $2k – $15k per baseline library

**R&D Value:**  
A control that drifts is no longer a control.

---

## Phase 2 — Alloy Addition & Modification Systems  
*(Inputs before melting)*

### Additions
- Carbon
- Common alloying elements
- Reclaimed material (with provenance)

### Documentation
- Alloy additions recorded as **mass %**, not anecdotal descriptors
- Source and purity recorded

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1k – $10k per addition system

**R&D Value:**  
Folklore begins where numbers stop.

---

## Phase 3 — Melt, Mix & Homogenization Control  
*(Mixing before claims)*

### Controls
- Melt temperature tracking
- Stirring and dwell time
- Slag management

### Documentation
- Homogenization time logged relative to melt volume
- Observed segregation recorded

**Price Anchor:**  
- $2k – $20k per melt-control setup

**R&D Value:**  
Unmixed metal lies politely.

---

## Phase 4 — Sample Casting & Test Coupon Creation  
*(Coupons before conclusions)*

### Coupon Standards
- Standardized geometries
- Consistent cooling paths
- Identical mold materials

### Doctrine
- Coupon geometry standardized across experiments unless variation is the variable

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1k – $12k per coupon system

**R&D Value:**  
Comparisons require sameness.

---

## Phase 5 — Heat Treatment Variance Studies  
*(Treatment before judgment)*

### Studies
- Normalize / quench / temper variants
- Time-at-temperature sweeps
- Cooling rate exploration

### Labeling
- Heat-treatment paths labeled with intent
  (e.g., “maximize toughness”, “probe brittleness”)

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1k – $15k per variance study set

**R&D Value:**  
Intent gives meaning to results.

---

## Phase 6 — Mechanical & Structural Testing  
*(Truth before enthusiasm)*

### Tests
- Bend tests
- Break tests
- Hardness comparisons

### QA Doctrine
- Test repeatability documented alongside absolute results
- Single data points never treated as conclusions

**Price Anchor:**  
- $500 – $8k per testing setup

**R&D Value:**  
Repeatability is credibility.

---

## Phase 7 — Failure Analysis & Negative Results Archive  
*(Failure before success)*

### Archive Rules
- All failures documented
- Root causes hypothesized
- Re-test conditions noted

> Negative results are cross-linked to any future hypothesis that risks repeating them.

**Price Anchor:**  
- $300 – $6k per archive system

**R&D Value:**  
Failure teaches faster than success—if remembered.

---

## Phase 8 — Documentation, Attribution & Cross-Linking  
*(Knowledge before credit)*

### Outputs
- Experiment logs
- Alloy recipes
- Test results
- Contributor attribution

### Publication Control
- Public vs restricted flags reviewed **before** publication
- Safety review precedes credit

**Price Anchor:**  
- $500 – $10k per documentation system

**R&D Value:**  
Transparency without restraint is negligence.

---

## Phase X — Reference Only  
### Instant Alloy Research Capability @ Current Market Prices (Non-Binding)

> This phase represents a hypothetical, immediate deployment of a complete
> workshop-scale alloy research capability using current market pricing.
> It is not part of Phases 0–8 and does not represent planned expenditure.
> Included to anchor realism and support future ARGENT-based reinvestment modeling.

### Assumptions
- Workshop-scale melts only
- Conservative safety margins
- Apprentice + master redundancy
- Immediate readiness prioritized over slow ramp

---

### Order-of-Magnitude Cost Reference

#### Baseline Libraries & Alloy Inputs
➡️ **$600k – $1.6M**

#### Melt, Mixing & Coupon Infrastructure
➡️ **$800k – $2.2M**

#### Testing, QA & Documentation Systems
➡️ **$500k – $1.2M**

---

### Reference Total (SP008 Only)
> **~$1.9M – $5.0M USD**

This excludes:
- Production rollout
- Certification programs
- Industrial-scale alloying
- Toxic material handling beyond review scope

---

## Contribution Modes (Explicit)
- Alloy inputs and baseline materials
- Testing and QA tooling
- Metallurgical analysis expertise
- Documentation and archival systems
- Funding earmarked **SP008 only**

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Production deployment
- Certification or standards claims
- Industrial-scale alloy development
- Unsafe or unreviewed materials

---

## Status
**Current:** Alloy experimentation doctrine defined and cost-anchored  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Variables isolated  
✔ Results repeatable  
✔ Knowledge preserved

### Why SP008 Matters
Curiosity without restraint burns people.

SP008 lets curiosity learn without harm.
