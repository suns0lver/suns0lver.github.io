## SP007 — Finishing, Grinding & Edge Geometry

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP007 governs **truth at the surface**.

Finishing is where metallurgy either keeps its promises or lies.
No amount of good steel survives dishonest grinding.

> A tool that isn’t finished correctly is lying, no matter how good the steel is.  
> This SP is truth at the surface, not bulk metallurgy.

---

## Phase 0 — Edge & Surface Doctrine  
*(Define truth before motion)*

### Core Principles
- Geometry determines function
- Finish reveals heat-treatment errors
- Edges fail honestly when shaped honestly

### Documentation
- Edge geometry tolerances documented **per tool class**
  (chisel vs knife vs punch vs scraper)

**R&D Value:**  
Edges are purpose-built, not interchangeable.

---

## Phase 1 — Primary Grinding Infrastructure

### Systems
- Belt grinders
- Wheel grinders
- Slow-speed finishing grinders

### Control Doctrine
- Wheel diameter logged relative to hollow-grind depth
- Grinder rigidity verified before precision work

**Price Anchor:**  
- $2k – $40k per grinding station

**R&D Value:**  
Changing wheel diameter quietly changes geometry.

---

## Phase 2 — Abrasives, Wheels & Media

### Media
- Coarse shaping abrasives
- Medium refinement media
- Fine finishing stones and belts

### Process Control
- Abrasive wear state tracked (fresh vs glazed)
- Media retired based on heat behavior, not appearance

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1k – $15k per abrasive inventory

**R&D Value:**  
Dull abrasives burn steel faster than sharp ones cut it.

---

## Phase 3 — Heat Control & Burn Prevention  
*(Protect prior metallurgy)*

### Controls
- Intermittent grinding
- Cooling intervals
- Water or air quench as appropriate

### Verification
- Burn detection includes **hardness spot checks**, not just visual cues
- Suspected burns trigger re-heat-treatment review

**Price Anchor:**  
- $500 – $8k per burn-control setup

**R&D Value:**  
Invisible burns are still failures.

---

## Phase 4 — Precision Geometry & Repeatability

### Geometry Control
- Bevel angles
- Edge thickness
- Symmetry and alignment

### Verification
- Angle verification performed **under working pressure**, not free-spin
- Jigs validated hot and cold

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1k – $20k per precision geometry system

**R&D Value:**  
Edges lie when measured unloaded.

---

## Phase 5 — Hand Finishing & Refinement

### Techniques
- Stones
- Files
- Scrapers
- Strops

### Doctrine
- Hand finishing documented as **correction**, not decoration
- No cosmetic polish without functional justification

**Price Anchor:**  
- $500 – $10k per hand-finishing kit

**R&D Value:**  
Polish without purpose hides mistakes.

---

## Phase 6 — Inspection, Verification & QA

### Inspection Methods
- Visual inspection
- Functional cutting tests
- Edge stability tests

### QA Doctrine
- Functional tests matched to **intended failure mode**
- Results logged against geometry and heat history

**Price Anchor:**  
- $500 – $6k per inspection setup

**R&D Value:**  
Edges fail differently. Tests must reflect that.

---

## Phase 7 — Tool Identification, Marking & Lifecycle Tracking  
*(Memory before myth)*

### Systems
- Maker’s marks
- Geometry codes
- Use-history tracking

> Tools without identity cannot teach.

**Price Anchor:**  
- $300 – $5k per marking and tracking system

**R&D Value:**  
An anonymous tool has no future.

---

## Phase X — Reference Only  
### Instant Precision Finishing Capability @ Current Market Prices (Non-Binding)

> This phase represents a hypothetical, immediate deployment of complete
> grinding, finishing, and edge-geometry infrastructure using current market pricing.
> It is not part of Phases 0–7 and does not represent planned expenditure.
> Included to anchor realism and support future ARGENT-based reinvestment modeling.

### Assumptions
- Multiple finishing stations
- Apprentice + master redundancy
- Conservative heat margins
- Immediate readiness prioritized over slow skill ramp

---

### Order-of-Magnitude Cost Reference

#### Grinding & Abrasive Infrastructure
➡️ **$900k – $2.4M**

#### Precision Geometry & Verification Systems
➡️ **$600k – $1.6M**

#### Hand Finishing & QA Tooling
➡️ **$400k – $1.0M**

---

### Reference Total (SP007 Only)
> **~$1.9M – $5.0M USD**

This excludes:
- Forge and fire systems
- Heat treatment programs
- Alloy research
- Casting infrastructure

---

## Contribution Modes (Explicit)
- Grinding and finishing equipment
- Abrasives and media
- QA and inspection tooling
- Documentation systems
- Funding earmarked **SP007 only**

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Fire generation
- Forging and shaping
- Heat treatment
- Alloy experimentation

---

## Status
**Current:** Surface truth doctrine defined and cost-anchored  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Geometry honest  
✔ Heat preserved  
✔ Edges trustworthy

### Why SP007 Matters
Steel earns trust at the edge.

SP007 decides whether that trust survives contact.
