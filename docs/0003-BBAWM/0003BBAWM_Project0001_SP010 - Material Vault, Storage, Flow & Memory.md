## SP010 — Material Vault, Storage, Flow & Memory

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP010 governs **material memory as infrastructure**.

Metallurgy without memory repeats mistakes.
Storage is not shelving — it is epistemic control.

> This SP is memory-first infrastructure, not throughput optimization.  
> No anonymous material.

---

## Phase 0 — Material Taxonomy & State Model  
*(Meaning before furniture)*

### Core Principles
- All material exists in a defined **state**
- State transitions are **irreversible without explicit re-classification**
- Ambiguity is treated as a risk, not a convenience

**R&D Value:**  
If state is unclear, trust is gone.

---

## Phase 1 — Raw Stock & Ingot Vaults  
*(Raw truth before process)*

### Storage Doctrine
- Known alloys segregated by composition and provenance
- Unknown provenance stock **physically segregated** from known material
- Intake inspection logged before vault entry

**Price Anchor:**  
- $2k – $25k per raw-material vault zone

**R&D Value:**  
Unknown metal is not “cheap metal” — it is deferred uncertainty.

---

## Phase 2 — Experimental & In-Process Material Zones  
*(Ambiguity isolated)*

### Zone Rules
- Active experiments isolated from production stock
- Material labeled by experiment ID, phase, and owner

### Exit Criteria
- Quarantine exit criteria explicitly defined
- Materials without exit clearance remain quarantined indefinitely

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1k – $15k per experimental storage zone

**R&D Value:**  
Temporary ambiguity becomes permanent if not bounded.

---

## Phase 3 — Tool & Die Vaults  
*(Tools remembered)*

### Storage Systems
- Individual tool cradles
- Edge-protective housings
- Geometry-preserving supports

### Doctrine
- Edge contact surfaces defined and protected
- Tool orientation logged to prevent stress memory

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1k – $20k per tool vault system

**R&D Value:**  
Storage is part of the tool’s life cycle.

---

## Phase 4 — Environmental Control & Preservation  
*(Time slowed)*

### Controls
- Humidity management
- Corrosion inhibition
- Atmosphere isolation where required

### Documentation
- Preservation method logged per material class
- Preservation reviewed periodically

**Price Anchor:**  
- $2k – $30k per environmental control zone

**R&D Value:**  
Time destroys quietly. Preservation must be louder.

---

## Phase 5 — Internal Logistics & Flow Control  
*(Motion made safe)*

### Flow Doctrine
- One-directional material flow enforced
- Reverse-flow paths explicitly forbidden unless documented
- Movement logged at each transition

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1k – $18k per internal flow system

**R&D Value:**  
Unlogged motion creates lost history.

---

## Phase 6 — Digital + Physical Provenance Tracking  
*(Ground truth preserved)*

### Systems
- Physical tags
- Digital records
- Cross-linked identifiers

### Conflict Resolution
- Physical tags treated as **authoritative** over digital entries during conflict
- Discrepancies trigger audit, not overwrite

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1k – $15k per tracking system

**R&D Value:**  
Reality beats databases.

---

## Phase 7 — Scrap, Salvage & Failure Archives  
*(Failure retained)*

### Archive Doctrine
- Scrap is never anonymous
- Salvage retains failure context
- Scrap linked to originating process or experiment

> Scrap is never anonymous.

**Price Anchor:**  
- $500 – $10k per archive system

**R&D Value:**  
Failure forgotten will repeat.

---

## Phase 8 — Output Staging & Cross-Domain Handoff  
*(Knowledge travels)*

### Handoff Rules
- Output packets include:
  - Material state
  - Process history
  - Failure and rework history
- No handoff without full context

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1k – $20k per staging system

**R&D Value:**  
Downstream teams deserve truth, not myths.

---

## Phase X — Reference Only  
### Instant Memory Infrastructure @ Current Market Prices (Non-Binding)

> This phase represents a hypothetical, immediate deployment of complete
> material memory, storage, and flow-control infrastructure using current
> market pricing.
> It is not part of Phases 0–8 and does not represent planned expenditure.
> Included to anchor realism and support future ARGENT-based reinvestment modeling.

### Assumptions
- Full workshop-scale vaulting
- Digital + physical redundancy
- Apprentice + master access layers
- Immediate readiness prioritized over ad-hoc growth

---

### Order-of-Magnitude Cost Reference

#### Vaults, Storage & Environmental Control
➡️ **$700k – $1.9M**

#### Tracking, Flow & Archival Systems
➡️ **$600k – $1.4M**

---

### Reference Total (SP010 Only)
> **~$1.3M – $3.3M USD**

This excludes:
- External logistics
- ERP systems
- JIT optimization
- Undocumented disposal

---

## Contribution Modes (Explicit)
- Storage and vault infrastructure
- Environmental control systems
- Provenance tracking tooling
- Archival and documentation systems
- Funding earmarked **SP010 only**

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- External logistics networks
- Enterprise ERP software
- Just-in-time fragility
- Anonymous disposal

---

## Status
**Current:** Memory-first material infrastructure defined and cost-anchored  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ No anonymous material  
✔ State preserved  
✔ History travels

### Why SP010 Matters
Workshops forget faster than people realize.

SP010 makes forgetting expensive.
