## SP004 — Workholding, Benches & Fixtures

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP004 defines the **restraint infrastructure** of the workshop.

If SP003 establishes truth,  
SP004 ensures that truth **cannot move** while work is performed.

This SP prioritizes:
- Predictable restraint under load
- Repeatable positioning
- Safety under leverage
- Scalability from hand-scale to TREE-scale work

This SP is restraint, not motion.

---

## Phase 0 — Load Envelope & Scale Definition  
*(Truth before timber)*

### Scope
- Static and dynamic load characterization
- Force vectors introduced by human leverage
- Cantilevered loads and torsion
- Worst-case misuse scenarios

> Loads include dynamic forces introduced by human leverage, not just static weight.

**R&D Value:**  
Prevents benches and fixtures from becoming the failure point.

---

## Phase 1 — Primary Workbenches (Human-Scale Precision)

### Bench Types
- Cabinetmaker’s benches
- Joiner’s benches
- Assembly benches
- Planing and shooting benches

### Core Requirements
- Bench mass prioritized over portability
- Flatness maintained under seasonal movement
- Rigid joinery with no racking under force
- Replaceable wear surfaces where appropriate

**Price Anchor:**  
- $2k – $15k per bench (materials + build)

**R&D Value:**  
Precision work requires immovable reference surfaces.

---

## Phase 2 — Large-Timber Work Platforms (TREE Scale)

### Platforms
- Timber framing decks
- Beam cradles
- Elevated support frames

### Requirements
- Multi-point anchoring
- Clearance for drawknives, adzes, and saws
- Safe access from multiple sides

**Price Anchor:**  
- $5k – $40k per platform

**R&D Value:**  
Enables accurate work on material larger than the human body.

---

## Phase 3 — Vises & Clamping Systems

### Tool Classes
- Face vises
- Leg vises
- Twin-screw vises
- Patternmaker’s vises
- Holdfast systems

### Selection Criteria
- Jaw parallelism for precision work
- High clamping force without racking
- Repairable screw mechanisms

**Price Anchor:**  
- $300 – $5,000 per vise or clamping system

**R&D Value:**  
A vise that racks lies to the hand.

---

## Phase 4 — Fixtures, Jigs & Repeatability Systems

### Scope
- Alignment fixtures
- Drilling and boring guides
- Angle and curve guides
- Repeatability stops

### Doctrine
- Fixtures are **purpose-built and reconfigurable**
- Fixtures are rebuilt or revised when tolerances drift
- No fixture is considered permanent if it compromises accuracy

**R&D Value:**  
Fixtures exist to enforce geometry, not sentiment.

---

## Phase 5 — Vertical & Rotational Workholding

### Systems
- Rotating frames
- Tilting cradles
- Vertical clamping walls
- Adjustable-angle locking systems

### Requirements
- Locking at intermediate angles (not just 0° / 90°)
- Positive locking under eccentric loads

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1k – $15k per system

**R&D Value:**  
Gravity should assist work, not fight it.

---

## Phase 6 — Anchoring, Floor Integration & Safety

### Anchoring Methods
- Floor-bolted systems
- Embedded anchor points
- Wall and post tie-ins

### Safety Doctrine
- Anchoring systems must fail **predictably**, not catastrophically
- Human escape paths remain clear under load

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1k – $10k per anchoring zone

**R&D Value:**  
Restraint that fails unpredictably is a hazard.

---

## Phase 7 — Mobile & Field-Deployable Workholding

### Systems
- Knockdown benches
- Portable clamping frames
- Temporary field fixtures

### Requirements
- Rapid setup and teardown
- Reduced mass with controlled stiffness
- Compatibility with permanent shop standards

**Price Anchor:**  
- $500 – $5,000 per mobile system

**R&D Value:**  
Precision should travel when required.

---

## Phase X — Reference Only  
### Instant Full-Scale Build-Out @ Current Market Prices (Non-Binding)

> This phase represents a hypothetical, immediate deployment of full-scale
> workholding, benching, and fixture infrastructure using current market pricing.
> It is not part of Phases 0–7 and does not represent planned expenditure.
> Included to anchor realism and support future ARGENT-based reinvestment modeling.

### Assumptions
- Multiple workshops
- Apprentice + master redundancy
- TREE-scale timber handling
- Rapid readiness prioritized over incremental build

---

### Order-of-Magnitude Cost Reference

#### Primary Benches & Precision Stations
➡️ **$400k – $1.2M**

#### Large-Timber Platforms & Frames
➡️ **$300k – $1.0M**

#### Vises & Clamping Infrastructure
➡️ **$250k – $900k**

#### Fixtures & Repeatability Systems
➡️ **$200k – $600k**

#### Anchoring, Safety & Field Systems
➡️ **$150k – $500k**

---

### Reference Total (SP004 Only)
> **~$1.3M – $4.2M USD**

This excludes:
- Cutting tools (SP002)
- Measurement doctrine (SP003)
- Mechanical power systems (later SPs)
- Cranes and heavy lift (MIFF)

---

## Contribution Modes (Explicit)
- Bench and vise hardware
- Fixture design expertise
- Timber and structural materials
- Anchoring and safety engineering
- Funding earmarked **SP004 only**

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Cutting tools
- Measurement and tolerance logic
- Mechanical or powered motion
- Heavy lifting equipment

---

## Status
**Current:** Workholding doctrine defined and cost-anchored  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Benches resist dynamic loads  
✔ Fixtures maintain tolerance under repetition  
✔ Anchoring fails predictably

### Why SP004 Is Quietly Dominant
If the work moves, the truth moves.

SP004 ensures the work does not move.
