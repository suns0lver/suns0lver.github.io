## SP006 — Heavy Carpentry & Structural Fabrication

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP006 governs the transformation of raw timber into **load-bearing infrastructure**.

This SP exists to:
- Shape large material safely
- Assemble structures honestly
- Validate load paths visibly
- Ensure frames can be raised, inspected, and repaired without modern dependency

> This SP is where trees become infrastructure.

---

## Phase 0 — Structural Doctrine & Load Mapping  
*(Truth before timber)*

### Scope
- Dead loads, live loads, and dynamic loads
- Creep under sustained load
- Seasonal moisture cycling and dimensional movement
- Human-induced transient loads during assembly

> Design loads must account for creep and seasonal moisture cycling.

**R&D Value:**  
Prevents long-span failure that only appears years later.

---

## Phase 1 — Timber Handling & Orientation

### Handling Systems
- Timber skids and rollers
- Leverage bars and peaveys
- Slings, chokers, and spreaders
- **Mini shop cranes (human-powered or mechanically simple)**

### Safety Doctrine
- All lifting systems rated at **minimum 5× safety factor**
- No single-point lifts for critical members
- Clear human escape paths at all times

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1k – $15k per handling station

**R&D Value:**  
Controlled movement prevents damage before cutting begins.

---

## Phase 2 — Rough Shaping & Dimensioning

### Processes
- Hewing
- Adzing
- Broad-axe dimensioning
- Reference face establishment

**Price Anchor:**  
- $2k – $20k per shaping station

**R&D Value:**  
Accuracy begins before joinery exists.

---

## Phase 3 — Structural Joinery

### Joinery Classes
- Mortise and tenon (through, wedged, housed)
- Scarf joints
- Bridle joints
- Lap joints

### Doctrine
- Joinery faces must remain readable after assembly for inspection
- No hidden load paths

**Price Anchor:**  
- $2k – $25k per joinery station

**R&D Value:**  
If you can’t read the joint, you can’t trust it.

---

## Phase 4 — Pegging, Locking & Assembly

### Techniques
- Drawboring
- Wedging
- Mechanical locking without adhesives

### Controlled Variables
- Peg grain orientation
- Peg moisture content at installation

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1k – $10k per assembly zone

**R&D Value:**  
A joint should tighten itself under load, not loosen.

---

## Phase 5 — Alignment, Leveling & Verification

### Verification Methods
- Plumb bobs and optical levels
- Story poles
- Test loading prior to final fixing

> Verification occurs before, during, and after load introduction.

**Price Anchor:**  
- $500 – $5k per verification kit

**R&D Value:**  
A frame that cannot be verified is already suspect.

---

## Phase 6 — Temporary Support, Bracing & Staging

### Systems
- Temporary braces
- Deadmen anchors
- Assembly staging frames

### Doctrine
- Temporary systems must exceed final structural load ratings
- Temporary supports are inspected as rigorously as permanent ones

**Price Anchor:**  
- $2k – $20k per staging setup

**R&D Value:**  
Most failures occur before the structure is finished.

---

## Phase 7 — Field Assembly, Disassembly & Repair

### Scope
- Modular erection sequences
- Controlled disassembly paths
- Member replacement strategies
- Documentation of repair procedures

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1k – $10k per field deployment kit

**R&D Value:**  
A structure that cannot be repaired is disposable.

---

## Phase X — Reference Only  
### Instant Full-Scale Build-Out @ Current Market Prices (Non-Binding)

> This phase represents a hypothetical, immediate deployment of full-scale
> heavy carpentry and structural fabrication capability using current market pricing.
> It is not part of Phases 0–7 and does not represent planned expenditure.
> Included to anchor realism and support future ARGENT-based reinvestment modeling.

### Assumptions
- Multiple workshops
- TREE-scale timber handling
- Apprentice + master redundancy
- Mini shop cranes permitted (non-powered, mechanical advantage only)
- Speed of readiness prioritized over incremental build

---

### Order-of-Magnitude Cost Reference

#### Timber Handling & Mini Crane Infrastructure
➡️ **$500k – $1.5M**

#### Shaping & Joinery Stations
➡️ **$600k – $2.0M**

#### Assembly, Pegging & Verification Systems
➡️ **$400k – $1.2M**

#### Temporary Bracing & Staging Infrastructure
➡️ **$300k – $900k**

---

### Reference Total (SP006 Only)
> **~$1.8M – $5.6M USD**

This excludes:
- Powered cranes or hoists (MIFF)
- Metal structural systems
- Composite frames
- Electrical machinery

---

## Contribution Modes (Explicit)
- Timber handling hardware
- Mini crane and lifting system design
- Joinery expertise
- Structural verification techniques
- Funding earmarked **SP006 only**

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Powered cranes or hoists
- Metal or composite structures
- CNC milling or automation
- Heavy industrial lift equipment

---

## Status
**Current:** Structural doctrine defined and cost-anchored  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Load paths verified  
✔ Assembly safety validated  
✔ Repairability proven

### Why SP006 Is the Point of No Return
Once this SP begins, mistakes weigh tons.

SP006 ensures the structure tells the truth — before it is trusted.
