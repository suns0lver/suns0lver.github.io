## SP003 — Joinery, Precision Handcraft & Measurement

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP003 governs **decision-making at the interface of geometry and force**.

If SP002 is how material is moved,  
SP003 is how material is *decided*.

This SP establishes absolute standards for:
- Dimensional truth
- Joinery integrity
- Tolerance discipline
- Verification over appearance

---

## Phase 0 — Geometric Doctrine & Tolerances  
*(Truth before technique)*

### Foundational Definitions
- Reference faces precede all measurement
- Tolerance is **directional**:
  - Strength-critical tolerances are non-negotiable
  - Appearance-critical tolerances are subordinate
- Errors compound unless arrested early

**R&D Value:**  
Prevents chasing perfection in the wrong dimensions.

---

## Phase 1 — Layout & Measurement (Truth Establishment)

### Instruments
- Master squares
- Marking gauges
- Story sticks
- Knife lines (preferred over pencil)
- Dividers and compasses

### Selection Criteria
- Dimensional stability over time
- Thermal stability under seasonal variation
- Resistance to wear and deformation

**Price Anchor:**  
- $300 – $3,000 for a complete, master-grade layout kit

**R&D Value:**  
Measurement defines reality; tools must not drift with weather.

---

## Phase 2 — Joinery Saws (Controlled Geometry)

### Tool Classes
- Tenon saws
- Dovetail saws
- Frame saws
- Japanese pull saws (comparative study)

**Price Anchor:**  
- $250 – $1,500 per saw

**R&D Value:**  
Joinery accuracy begins at the cut, not the chisel.

---

## Phase 3 — Chisels & Paring Tools

### Tool Classes
- Bench chisels
- Mortise chisels
- Paring chisels
- Skew and fishtail patterns (where required)

### Absolute Requirement
- Paring chisels must register **flat** against reference faces

**Price Anchor:**  
- $100 – $500 per chisel

**R&D Value:**  
Precision removal corrects the saw — it does not excuse it.

---

## Phase 4 — Planes for Joint Fit & Surface Control

### Tool Classes
- Router planes
- Shoulder planes
- Rabbet planes
- Shooting board planes

**Price Anchor:**  
- $300 – $2,000 per plane

**R&D Value:**  
Planes establish mechanical truth at mating surfaces.

---

## Phase 5 — Drilling, Pegging & Mechanical Locking

### Techniques
- Drawbored mortise-and-tenon
- Tapered pegs
- Mechanical locking without adhesives

### Critical Variable
- Peg moisture content must be controlled and documented

**Price Anchor:**  
- $200 – $1,500 for boring and pegging systems

**R&D Value:**  
A joint that tightens itself over time is engineered, not lucky.

---

## Phase 6 — Joint Verification & Stress Testing

### Verification Methods
- Dry-fit load testing
- Deflection observation
- Audible and tactile feedback
- Progressive stress application

> Visual perfection is not accepted without mechanical validation.

**R&D Value:**  
A joint that looks right but fails is unacceptable.

---

## Phase 7 — Documentation & Pattern Capture

### Outputs
- Joinery patterns
- Story stick records
- Annotated failures and corrections
- Transferable templates

**Price Anchor:**  
- $200 – $1,000 for archival documentation materials

**R&D Value:**  
Prevents rediscovering the same mistake twice.

---

## Phase X — Reference Only  
### Instant Full-Scale Build-Out @ Current Market Prices (Non-Binding)

> This phase represents a hypothetical, immediate acquisition of master-grade
> joinery, layout, and verification systems using current market pricing.
> It is not part of Phases 0–7 and does not represent planned expenditure.
> Included to anchor realism and support future ARGENT-based reinvestment modeling.

### Assumptions
- Multi-workshop deployment
- Apprentice + master redundancy
- Environmental variability (non-climate-controlled spaces)
- Immediate readiness prioritized over slow curation

---

### Order-of-Magnitude Cost Reference

#### Layout & Measurement Infrastructure
➡️ **$250k – $700k**

#### Joinery Saws & Cutting Systems
➡️ **$200k – $600k**

#### Chisels, Paring & Precision Removal
➡️ **$300k – $900k**

#### Joint Verification & Test Fixtures
➡️ **$150k – $400k**

#### Redundancy, Spares & Training Loss Buffer
➡️ **$200k – $500k**

---

### Reference Total (SP003 Only)
> **~$1.1M – $3.1M USD**

This excludes:
- Structural framing (SP006)
- Metallurgy (SP008)
- Mechanical power systems (SP005)

---

## Contribution Modes (Explicit)
- Master-grade joinery tools
- Measurement and layout instruments
- Documentation and pattern systems
- Craft validation expertise
- Funding earmarked **SP003 only**

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Structural framing
- Power tools
- Adhesive-dependent joinery
- Ornamentation

---

## Status
**Current:** Precision doctrine defined and cost-anchored  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Tolerance discipline enforced  
✔ Mechanical validation standardized  
✔ Patterns preserved for reuse

### Why SP003 Is the Spine of Trust
Anyone can make a joint look good.

SP003 ensures it *holds*.
