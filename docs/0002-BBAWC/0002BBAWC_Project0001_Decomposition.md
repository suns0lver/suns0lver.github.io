# BBAWC · Project0001  
## Back-to-Basics Archaic Workshop (Carpentry)

### Project Purpose
BBAWC establishes a survivable, low-energy, high-skill carpentry and fabrication workshop capable of operating indefinitely without grid dependence.  
The project prioritizes human skill, tool longevity, material stewardship, and knowledge preservation.

> **Note on Scope:**  
> This project intentionally contains **10 subprojects (SP001–SP010)**.  
> Future expansion concepts (e.g., upgrade paths, interstellar translation) are **intentionally deferred** to later projects.

## Decomposition Overview

Each SP is:
- Independently contributable
- Survivable without external infrastructure
- Bounded to prevent scope bleed
- Designed to function under material scarcity

---

## SP001 — Doctrine, Constraints & Workshop Topology

### Role
Defines the **constraints and doctrine** of the workshop, not production output.

### Scope
- Workshop philosophy (skill-first, power-last)
- Spatial layout and zoning
- Emergency operating modes
- Blueprint wall and knowledge taxonomy
- Joinery families and tolerances
- Material hierarchy (wood → composite → metal)

### Outputs
- Canonical workshop layout
- Operating constraints
- Knowledge classification schema

---

## SP002 — Zero-Energy Hand Tool Spine

### Scope
- Saws, planes, chisels, augers
- Sharpening systems
- Tool storage and care
- Ergonomic standards

### Purpose
Establishes the **minimum viable craft** layer.

---

## SP003 — Precision Handcraft & Joinery

### Scope
- Fine joinery (mortise/tenon, dovetail, scarf)
- Measurement and marking systems
- Tolerance control without electricity

### Purpose
Enables durable, repairable construction.

---

## SP004 — Workholding, Benches & Fixtures

### Scope
- Workbenches
- Vises and clamps
- Jigs and fixtures
- Repeatability aids

### Purpose
Turns skill into consistency.

---

## SP005 — Mechanical & Analog Power Systems

### Scope
- Foot-powered and hand-crank tools
- Flywheels, belts, pulleys
- Gear reduction and torque translation

### Boundary
> Electrical generation is explicitly out of scope.

### Purpose
Multiplies human effort without grid reliance.

---

## SP006 — Heavy Carpentry & Structural Fabrication

### Scope
- Timber framing
- Large-scale joinery
- Load-bearing assemblies
- Temporary and permanent structures

### Outcome
Enables construction of buildings, vessels, and frames **without grid power**.

---

## SP007 — Composite, Curved & Experimental Forms

### Scope
- Steam bending
- Laminations
- Natural resins and binders
- Hand-processable synthetics (explicitly allowed)

### Purpose
Extends form beyond rectilinear limits.

---

## SP008 — Primitive Metallurgy & Toolmaking

### Scope
- Forge construction
- Tool steel shaping
- Heat treatment
- Repair and reuse of metal tools

### Purpose
Ensures tool continuity when supply chains fail.

---

## SP009 — Material Preservation & Conditioning

### Scope
- Wood drying and storage
- Pest prevention
- Moisture control
- Long-term material stewardship

### Purpose
Prevents slow loss through neglect.

---

## SP010 — Knowledge Vault, Redundancy & Continuity

### Scope
- Blueprint archiving
- Pattern libraries
- Redundant physical records
- Artifact preservation

### Clarifier
> SP010 prioritizes **survivability over accessibility**.

### Purpose
Ensures the workshop can be rebuilt after catastrophe.

---

## Explicitly Deferred
- Upgrade paths beyond terrestrial fabrication
- Interstellar or zero-gravity translation
- Power-dense automation layers

These belong to later BBAWC projects.

---

## Contribution Philosophy
BBAWC accepts:
- Craft knowledge
- Tool patterns
- Material science insight
- Documentation refinement
- Targeted material donations

Contributions are **bounded to SPs** and **auditable**.

---

## Status
**Current:** Decomposition complete  
**Next Gate:** SP-level wishlists and validation phases

---

### Closing Note
BBAWC is not nostalgia.  
It is an insurance policy for civilization.

If everything else fails, this still works.
