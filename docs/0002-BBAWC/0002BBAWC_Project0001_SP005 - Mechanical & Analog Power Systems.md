## SP005 — Mechanical & Analog Power Systems

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP005 establishes **muscle → motion** as a dependable, inspectable, and survivable power layer.

This SP converts human effort into mechanical work while:
- Respecting sustainable human duty cycles
- Smoothing force for usable output
- Preserving control, safety, and reversibility
- Avoiding dependency on electricity or electronics

> This SP is muscle → motion, nothing else.

## Phase 0 — Force, Energy & Duty-Cycle Mapping  
*(Truth before transmission)*

### Scope
- Sustainable human power output vs emergency burst capacity
- Continuous vs intermittent duty cycles
- Torque vs speed tradeoffs
- Fatigue modeling over work sessions

**R&D Value:**  
Prevents designing systems that only work for heroes.

## Phase 1 — Treadle & Pedal Power Core

### Systems
- Foot treadles
- Pedal crank systems
- Flywheels (energy smoothing)

### Design Principles
- Flywheel mass tuned to task inertia, not maximized blindly
- Smooth startup torque preferred over peak speed
- Operator posture optimized for endurance

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1k – $10k per power station

**R&D Value:**  
Turns irregular human effort into steady usable motion.

---

## Phase 2 — Belt, Shaft & Gear Transmission

### Transmission Types
- Flat belts
- V-belts
- Rope drives
- Line shafts
- Spur and bevel gears

### Maintenance Discipline
- Belt tracking alignment
- Tension calibration
- Wear monitoring and replacement schedules

**Price Anchor:**  
- $500 – $8k per transmission system

**R&D Value:**  
Transmission losses compound silently unless managed.

---

## Phase 3 — Analog Machine Stations

### Machines
- Drill presses
- Lathes
- Grinders
- Saws (non-electric)

### Operational Constraint
- Machines must be operable at reduced power without stalling

**Price Anchor:**  
- $2k – $20k per machine station

**R&D Value:**  
Survivability beats throughput.

---

## Phase 4 — Speed Control, Clutching & Safety

### Control Systems
- Mechanical clutches
- Friction drives
- Fly-off governors
- Mechanical braking systems

### Safety Doctrine
- Every powered system must stop faster than it starts
- Clutches and brakes explicitly classified as:
  - Fail-open where load shedding is safer
  - Fail-closed where runaway is dangerous

**Price Anchor:**  
- $500 – $6k per control assembly

**R&D Value:**  
Control without safety is a liability.

---

## Phase 5 — Structural Mounting & Alignment

### Scope
- Rigid frames
- Adjustable mounts
- Vibration isolation
- Alignment reference points

### Verification
- Alignment rechecked after thermal or humidity cycling

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1k – $12k per mounted system

**R&D Value:**  
Misalignment destroys efficiency before it breaks machines.

---

## Phase 6 — Instrumentation & Efficiency Study

### Measurements
- RPM indicators
- Torque estimation
- Mechanical power output tracking
- Baseline human caloric expenditure estimates

**Price Anchor:**  
- $300 – $3k for instrumentation per station

**R&D Value:**  
Efficiency must be human-centric, not abstract.

---

## Phase 7 — Modular Expansion & Knowledge Capture

### Outputs
- Modular transmission diagrams
- Load vs output charts
- Failure modes and corrections
- Maintenance schedules

**Price Anchor:**  
- $200 – $2k for documentation & reference artifacts

**R&D Value:**  
A system that cannot be explained cannot be sustained.

---

## Phase X — Reference Only  
### Instant Full-Scale Build-Out @ Current Market Prices (Non-Binding)

> This phase represents a hypothetical, immediate deployment of complete
> human-powered mechanical systems using current market pricing.
> It is not part of Phases 0–7 and does not represent planned expenditure.
> Included to anchor realism and support future ARGENT-based reinvestment modeling.

### Assumptions
- Multiple workshops
- Apprentice + master redundancy
- Continuous daily operation
- Conservative duty cycles
- Speed of readiness prioritized over incremental fabrication

## Contribution Modes (Explicit)
- Mechanical power hardware
- Transmission components
- Analog machine tooling
- Safety and control design
- Funding earmarked **SP005 only**

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Electricity or electronics
- Automated or CNC machinery

## Status
**Current:** Mechanical power doctrine defined and cost-anchored  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Sustainable duty cycles validated  
✔ Transmission losses bounded  
✔ Safety behavior verified

### Why SP005 Is a Pivot
Without power, tools stall.  
With uncontrolled power, people get hurt.

SP005 ensures motion remains human-scale, legible, and safe.
