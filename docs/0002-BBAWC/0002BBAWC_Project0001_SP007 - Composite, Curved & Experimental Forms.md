## SP007 — Composite, Curved & Experimental Forms

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP007 governs **controlled experimentation with curvature and composites** in wood-based structures.

This SP exists to:
- Explore non-rectilinear load paths
- Develop curved and shell forms using earthbound methods
- Understand composite behavior through hands-on testing
- Fail safely, visibly, and informatively

> This SP is earthbound experimentation, not final aerospace hardware.

## Phase 0 — Curvature Doctrine & Load Logic  
*(Bend with intent)*

### Foundational Distinctions
- Elastic curvature vs plastic deformation
- Compression-dominant vs tension-dominant behavior
- Predictable spring-back vs permanent set

**R&D Value:**  
Prevents confusing “bent” with “structurally committed.”

---

## Phase 1 — Steam Bending Infrastructure

### Systems
- Steam boxes
- Boilers / kettles
- Bending forms
- Compression straps

### Safety Requirements
- Explicit burn and scald mitigation procedures
- Venting and pressure relief paths
- Controlled cooldown zones

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1k – $10k per steam bending setup

**R&D Value:**  
Steam bending is powerful, fast, and unforgiving.

---

## Phase 2 — Bent Lamination Systems

### Techniques
- Thin-laminate layups
- Manual vacuum bagging
- Clamp-based lamination

### Doctrine
- Cure-time variability is documented as a **structural variable**, not a nuisance
- Environmental conditions recorded during cure

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1k – $12k per lamination station

**R&D Value:**  
Lamination trades time for control.

---

## Phase 3 — Natural & Synthetic Composite Exploration

### Materials
- Natural resins
- Casein and bio-based binders
- Experimental fiber reinforcement
- Select modern epoxies (evaluation only)

### Boundary
- Modern epoxies are evaluated for behavior, not adopted by default

**Price Anchor:**  
- $500 – $8k per materials exploration set

**R&D Value:**  
Understanding composites matters more than choosing favorites.

---

## Phase 4 — Curved Joinery & Hybrid Joints

### Joinery Forms
- Scarfed curves
- Laminated tenons
- Hybrid pegged joints

### Verification
- Template accuracy verified before cutting curved members
- Compound curves checked at multiple stations

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1k – $15k per joinery setup

**R&D Value:**  
Curved errors compound faster than straight ones.

---

## Phase 5 — Experimental Forms & Shell Structures

### Structures
- Ribbed shells
- Vaults
- Domes
- Compression shells

### Doctrine
- Compression-dominant designs prioritized over tension-dominant where possible
- Load paths must be visually readable

**Price Anchor:**  
- $2k – $25k per experimental structure

**R&D Value:**  
Earth likes compression. Design accordingly.

---

## Phase 6 — Testing, Failure & Documentation

### Testing Methods
- Incremental loading
- Deflection tracking
- Crack and delamination observation
- Environmental cycling

> Failures are considered successful outcomes if they are reproducible and understood.

**Price Anchor:**  
- $500 – $5k per testing cycle

**R&D Value:**  
Unmeasured failure teaches nothing.

---

## Phase 7 — Pattern Capture & Knowledge Encoding

### Outputs
- Full-scale patterns
- Mold and form drawings
- Failure annotations
- Load vs geometry records

**Price Anchor:**  
- $200 – $3k for archival systems

**R&D Value:**  
Curvature knowledge must survive the experimenter.

---

## Phase X — Reference Only  
### Instant Full-Scale Build-Out @ Current Market Prices (Non-Binding)

> This phase represents a hypothetical, immediate deployment of composite and curved-form
> experimentation infrastructure using current market pricing.
> It is not part of Phases 0–7 and does not represent planned expenditure.
> Included to anchor realism and support future ARGENT-based reinvestment modeling.

### Assumptions
- Multiple workshops
- High failure tolerance
- Apprentice + master redundancy
- Emphasis on speed of insight over material thrift

### Order-of-Magnitude Cost Reference

#### Steam Bending & Lamination Infrastructure
➡️ **$400k – $1.2M**

#### Composite Materials & Tooling
➡️ **$300k – $900k**

#### Curved Joinery & Shell Fabrication
➡️ **$500k – $1.6M**

#### Testing, Failure & Documentation Systems
➡️ **$200k – $600k**

---

### Reference Total (SP007 Only)
> **~$1.4M – $4.3M USD**

This excludes:
- Metal composites
- Pressure vessels
- Automated layup systems
- Space-rated structures

---

## Contribution Modes (Explicit)
- Curved-form tooling
- Composite material research
- Structural testing expertise
- Pattern and mold design
- Funding earmarked **SP007 only**

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Aerospace or pressure-rated structures
- Metal composites
- Automated composite fabrication
- Spaceflight hardware

---

## Status
**Current:** Experimental curvature doctrine defined and cost-anchored  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Curved load paths understood  
✔ Failure modes documented  
✔ Patterns preserved for reuse

### Why SP007 Exists
Straight lines are efficient.  
Curves are instructive.

SP007 teaches when bending becomes strength.
