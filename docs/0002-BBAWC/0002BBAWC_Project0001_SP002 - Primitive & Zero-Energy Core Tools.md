## SP002 — Primitive & Zero-Energy Core Tools

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP002 establishes the **irreducible tool spine** of the Back-to-Basics Archaic Workshop.

This SP defines the minimum set of hand tools required to:
- Shape wood accurately
- Join structures durably
- Repair tools indefinitely
- Operate without electricity or mechanical power

> **Cost Intent Clarifier:**  
> Cost ranges reflect acquisition of **master-grade, lineage-known tools**, not commodity hardware.

This SP is about **truth in force, edge, and geometry**.

---

## Phase 0 — Doctrine & Capability Mapping  
*(No tools until the hands know what they must do)*

### Scope
- Capability-first tool selection
- Force → accuracy → finish progression
- Tool dependency mapping
- Redundancy doctrine

**R&D Value:**  
Prevents tool accumulation without purpose.

---

## Phase 1 — Axes & Edge Tools (Primary Force)

### Tool Classes
- Felling axes
- Hewing axes
- Hatchets and carving axes

### Selection Criteria
- Heat treatment consistency over peak hardness
- Grain orientation in handles
- Balance and swing efficiency
- Field-sharpenable geometry

**R&D Value:**  
Axes establish the first conversation between human force and material.

---

## Phase 2 — Saws (Controlled Separation)

### Tool Classes
- Rip saws
- Crosscut saws
- Frame saws
- Tenon and dovetail saws

### Requirements
- Tooth geometry appropriate to task
- Resharpenable plates
- Stable spines and handles

**R&D Value:**  
Saws define accuracy without removing excess material.

---

## Phase 3 — Chisels, Gouges & Precision Removal

### Tool Classes
- Bench chisels
- Mortise chisels
- Firmer chisels
- Gouges (various sweeps)

### Constraints
- Bench chisel sizing must match joinery standards defined in **SP001**
- Steel optimized for repeated sharpening

**R&D Value:**  
This is where geometry becomes exact.

---

## Phase 4 — Boring, Drilling & Fastening

### Tool Classes
- Augers and brace systems
- Gimlets
- Hand drills
- Drawbore pins
- Wooden and metal mallets

**R&D Value:**  
Enables structural fastening without adhesives or fasteners.

---

## Phase 5 — Planes & Surface Truth

### Tool Classes
- Jack planes
- Try / jointer planes
- Smoothing planes
- Specialty planes (rabbet, plow, molding)

> Surface accuracy is surface honesty.

**R&D Value:**  
Planes reveal errors other tools hide.

---

## Phase 6 — Sharpening & Edge Stewardship

### Systems
- Coarse shaping stones
- Medium refinement stones
- Fine polishing stones
- Strops and compounds

### Discipline
- Primary vs secondary bevel angle control
- Edge geometry consistency over razor chasing

**R&D Value:**  
Sharpness is a process, not a moment.

---

## Phase 7 — Handles, Hafting & Ergonomics

### Scope
- Handle shaping and replacement
- Wood selection for shock absorption
- Ergonomic fit by hand size
- Seasonal movement compensation

**R&D Value:**  
A good tool that hurts the hand is a failed system.

---

## Phase 8 — Redundancy, Spares & Repair

### Strategy
- Duplicate critical tools
- Salvageable tool stock
- Repair-first mindset
- Knowledge transfer of maintenance techniques

> This phase ensures the tool system survives beyond its original makers.

**R&D Value:**  
Longevity beats novelty.

---

## Contribution Modes (Explicit)
- Master-grade hand tools
- Sharpening systems and stones
- Handle blanks and hafting materials
- Craft knowledge and repair techniques
- Funding earmarked **SP002 only**

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Electrical tools
- Mechanical or analog power systems
- Metallurgy and steel production
- Framing and large structural assemblies

These belong to later SPs.

---

## Status
**Current:** Core tool doctrine defined  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Tool spine validated  
✔ Sharpening discipline established  
✔ Redundancy strategy confirmed

### Why SP002 Is Foundational
If the hands cannot shape material truthfully,  
everything built later is a lie.

SP002 ensures the workshop can always begin again.
