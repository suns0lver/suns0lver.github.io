## SP001 — Philosophy, Layout & Flow

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP001 exists to design, encode, and preserve **how the workshop thinks**, ensuring that:
- Ideas survive personnel changes
- Plans remain readable across generations
- Digital precision and analog intuition coexist
- The workshop can be rebuilt from its own memory

This SP optimizes for **clarity, longevity, and transmission** — not speed.

SP001 governs **thought → plan**, not execution.

## Phase 0 — Workshop Cognition & Flow Design  
*(Before desks or drawers)*

### Conceptual Architecture
- Workshop zoning diagrams
- Material and human flow mapping
- Noise, dust, and vibration separation logic
- Emergency reconfiguration modes

**~$2k – $10k**

**R&D Value:**  
Prevents cognitive and physical bottlenecks before they exist.

---

## Phase 1 — Digital Blueprint Creation (Modern Precision)

### Primary CAD Workstation (Ceiling-Seeking)
- High-end multi-core CPU
- Professional GPU (CAD / simulation grade)
- ECC RAM (64–128 GB)
- Fast NVMe storage (mirrored)

**~$6k – $15k**

### Displays
- Dual or triple high-resolution monitors
- Color-accurate large-format primary display

**~$2k – $6k**

**R&D Value:**  
Enables exact geometry, simulation, and archival CAD.

---

## Phase 2 — Analog Drafting & Spatial Thinking (Timeless)

### Drafting Furniture
- Full-size professional drafting table  
  **~$2k – $8k**
- Adjustable ergonomic stool / chair

### Drafting Instruments (Best-in-Class)
- Precision T-squares
- Parallel motion system
- Mechanical pencils (various leads)
- Compass and divider sets
- French curves and ship curves
- Shadow-free drafting lamps
- Inking pens

**~$1k – $5k**

**R&D Value:**  
Analog drafting exposes geometric intuition digital tools hide.

---

## Phase 3 — Blueprint Wall & Physical Knowledge Encoding

### Blueprint Display & Storage
- Wall-mounted plan rails
- Archival flat files (acid-free)
- Vertical hanging systems
- Oversized pin boards

**~$2k – $10k**

### Permanent Encoding Media
- Etched metal reference plates
- Hardwood engraving panels
- Ceramic or slate plates (fire-resistant)

**~$1k – $6k**

**R&D Value:**  
Ensures core knowledge survives power loss and time.

---

## Phase 4 — Library & Reference Archive

### Physical Library
- Carpentry, joinery, shipbuilding, and framing texts
- Historical pattern books
- Geometry and measurement references
- Repair and restoration manuals

**~$1k – $10k**

### Digital Archive
- Redundant NAS systems
- Offline cold storage (write-once)
- Indexing and cataloging tools

**~$2k – $12k**

**R&D Value:**  
Prevents loss of institutional memory.

---

## Phase 5 — Measurement & Layout Reference Core

### Precision References
- Steel rules and straightedges
- Master squares
- Layout gauges
- Story stick systems
- Reference artifacts (known-true parts)

**~$1k – $6k**

**R&D Value:**  
Establishes geometric truth independent of machines.

---

## Phase 6 — Environmental Control (Cognition Protection)

### Workspace Conditioning
- Focus lighting (high CRI)
- Dust-isolated enclosure
- Acoustic dampening
- Climate stability (paper- and wood-safe)

**~$2k – $10k**

**R&D Value:**  
Protects thinking, drawings, and materials from degradation.

---

## Contribution Modes (Explicit)
- High-end workstation hardware
- Drafting furniture and instruments
- Archival and library materials
- Knowledge organization expertise
- Funding earmarked **SP001 only**

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Cutting tools (SP002+)
- Power or mechanical systems
- Structural fabrication
- Metallurgy

This SP defines **how work is conceived**, not how it is executed.

---

## Status
**Current:** Conceptual architecture definition  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Blueprint workflows defined  
✔ Analog and digital parity achieved  
✔ Knowledge survivability ensured

### Why SP001 Matters (Quietly)
If the shop forgets how it thinks,  
it eventually forgets how to build.

SP001 ensures BBAWC can regenerate itself.
