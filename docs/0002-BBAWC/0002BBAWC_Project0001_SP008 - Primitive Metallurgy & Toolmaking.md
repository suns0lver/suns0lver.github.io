## SP008 — Primitive Metallurgy & Toolmaking

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP008 establishes the workshop’s ability to **create, repair, and understand its own tools**.

This SP exists to:
- Close the dependency loop on tooling
- Build metallurgical intuition through controlled fire
- Produce durable, repairable tools at human scale
- Preserve knowledge through documented practice

> If you cannot make or repair your own tools, you do not truly own your workshop.

---

## Phase 0 — Metallurgical Doctrine & Safety  
*(Fire before force)*

### Doctrine
- Exploratory heats are explicitly separated from production heats
- Fire, impact, and quench hazards are treated as first-order risks
- No process proceeds without a clear abort condition

**R&D Value:**  
Prevents learning accidents from becoming production failures.

---

## Phase 1 — Fire & Heat Generation

### Systems
- Solid-fuel forges (charcoal, coke)
- Gas forges (propane / natural gas)
- Bellows and forced-air control

### Control Variables
- Fuel sourcing and consistency logged as a metallurgical variable
- Heat zones mapped and repeatable

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1k – $12k per forge setup

**R&D Value:**  
Heat quality defines metal behavior before the hammer touches it.

---

## Phase 2 — Anvils, Mass & Impact Control

### Infrastructure
- Anvils (varied mass)
- Swage blocks
- Stakes and forming blocks

### Verification
- Anvil rebound measured and recorded
- Mass-to-task alignment documented

**Price Anchor:**  
- $2k – $25k per anvil and support system

**R&D Value:**  
Mass stores work. Measure it.

---

## Phase 3 — Hammering, Shaping & Striking

### Tools
- Hand hammers
- Sledges
- Specialized striking tools
- Multi-person striking setups

### Safety & Coordination
- Communication protocols defined for striker teams
- Clear strike zones and verbal cues enforced

**Price Anchor:**  
- $500 – $6k per striking set

**R&D Value:**  
Poor coordination ruins steel faster than bad heat.

---

## Phase 4 — Heat Treatment & Metallurgical Control

### Processes
- Normalizing
- Quenching
- Tempering

### Doctrine
- Normalize cycles documented even when not strictly required
- Quench media recorded and compared

**Price Anchor:**  
- $500 – $5k per heat-treatment station

**R&D Value:**  
Hardness without control is fragility.

---

## Phase 5 — Small-Scale Casting & Mold Making

### Scope
- Tool fittings
- Hardware components
- Non-critical cast elements

### Boundary
- Casting is for components and fittings, **not primary load-bearing frames**

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1k – $10k per casting setup

**R&D Value:**  
Casting teaches flow; forging teaches grain.

---

## Phase 6 — Tool Finishing & Sharpening

### Processes
- Grinding
- Filing
- Honing
- Polishing

### Critical Control
- Grinding heat management explicitly documented

**Price Anchor:**  
- $500 – $6k per finishing station

**R&D Value:**  
A burned edge erases hours of correct work.

---

## Phase 7 — Tool Reproduction & Pattern Library

### Outputs
- Tool patterns
- Forging sequences
- Heat-treatment recipes
- Failure and success archives

> Failures are archived alongside successes.

**Price Anchor:**  
- $200 – $3k for documentation systems

**R&D Value:**  
Reproducibility is sovereignty.

---

## Phase X — Reference Only  
### Instant Full-Scale Build-Out @ Current Market Prices (Non-Binding)

> This phase represents a hypothetical, immediate deployment of primitive
> metallurgy and toolmaking capability using current market pricing.
> It is not part of Phases 0–7 and does not represent planned expenditure.
> Included to anchor realism and support future ARGENT-based reinvestment modeling.

### Assumptions
- Multiple workshops
- Apprentice + master redundancy
- Conservative safety margins
- Immediate readiness prioritized over slow tooling-up

### Order-of-Magnitude Cost Reference

#### Fire & Forge Infrastructure
➡️ **$400k – $1.2M**

#### Anvils, Mass & Impact Systems
➡️ **$500k – $1.6M**

#### Striking, Shaping & Coordination Tools
➡️ **$300k – $900k**

#### Heat Treatment & Finishing Systems
➡️ **$300k – $900k**

#### Pattern Libraries & Documentation
➡️ **$150k – $400k**

---

### Reference Total (SP008 Only)
> **~$1.65M – $5.0M USD**

This excludes:
- Large-scale smelting
- Rolling mills
- Automated forging
- Advanced alloy production

---

## Contribution Modes (Explicit)
- Forge and anvil hardware
- Tool steel stock
- Metallurgical expertise
- Safety systems
- Funding earmarked **SP008 only**

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Industrial-scale smelting
- Automated or powered forging
- Advanced alloy development
- Structural metal frames

---

## Status
**Current:** Foundational metallurgy doctrine defined and cost-anchored  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Fire control verified  
✔ Tool quality reproducible  
✔ Knowledge archived

### Why SP008 Is Non-Negotiable
A workshop that cannot repair its tools is temporary.

SP008 makes permanence possible.
