## SP010 — Material Vault, Long-Term Storage, Logistics & Flow

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP010 governs **order over time**.

This SP exists to:
- Preserve material integrity across years
- Maintain knowledge of location, condition, and intent
- Enable smooth internal flow without lifting heroics
- Prevent loss through neglect, mislabeling, or false efficiency

> This SP turns inventory into infrastructure memory.

---

## Phase 0 — Material Taxonomy & Flow Doctrine  
*(Name before containment)*

### Classification Principles
- Material type, grade, and form
- Condition state (new, seasoned, reclaimed, unknown)
- Intended use horizon (immediate, medium-term, long-term)
- Provenance and inspection status

> “Unknown” is an explicit, temporary classification — not an error state.

**R&D Value:**  
Prevents silent decay of untracked material.

---

## Phase 1 — Primary Material Vaults

### Vault Types
- Lumber vaults
- Metal stock vaults
- Composite and experimental material zones
- Consumables storage

### Labeling Doctrine
- Racks and bins labeled for contents **and intended turnover rate**
- Visual identifiers readable at distance

**Price Anchor:**  
- $5k – $50k per vault zone

**R&D Value:**  
Material lasts longer when its future is known.

---

## Phase 2 — Controlled Environment Zones

### Environmental Controls
- Humidity buffering
- Ventilation
- Temperature moderation
- Pest exclusion

### Control Doctrine
- Environmental zones logged with **drift tolerance ranges**, not single target values
- Deviations recorded, not ignored

**Price Anchor:**  
- $10k – $100k per controlled zone

**R&D Value:**  
Perfect control is fragile. Bounded control is resilient.

---

## Phase 3 — Handling, Transport & Internal Logistics

### Systems
- Carts and dollies
- Rollers and skids
- Gravity-assisted flow paths
- Clear aisle zoning

> Flow beats lifting. Always.

### Design Controls
- Turning radius and choke-point mapping for all transport paths
- No blind load movement zones

**Price Anchor:**  
- $3k – $30k per logistics lane

**R&D Value:**  
Effort spent moving material is effort not spent shaping it.

---

## Phase 4 — Tool & Fixture Vaults

### Vault Scope
- Hand tools
- Jigs and fixtures
- Patterns and templates
- Measuring instruments

### Maintenance Doctrine
- Shadow boards updated when tools change role or are retired
- Missing tools flagged visually before digital escalation

**Price Anchor:**  
- $5k – $40k per tool vault

**R&D Value:**  
A missing tool is a system failure, not a scavenger hunt.

---

## Phase 5 — Digital + Physical Inventory Sync

### Inventory Systems
- Physical labels and tags
- Simple digital registries
- Location-indexed records

### Resilience Requirement
- **Visual-only fallback required if digital systems fail**
- No single point of truth allowed

**Price Anchor:**  
- $2k – $20k per inventory system

**R&D Value:**  
Memory must survive power loss.

---

## Phase 6 — Ingress / Egress & Output Flow

### Flow Control
- Incoming material inspection zones
- Quarantine and seasoning areas
- Outgoing material staging

### Documentation
- Material quarantine duration logged explicitly
- Release criteria recorded before use

**Price Anchor:**  
- $5k – $50k per ingress/egress lane

**R&D Value:**  
Bad material spreads faster than good judgment.

---

## Phase 7 — Archival, Salvage & Reuse Systems

### Systems
- Salvage racks
- Deconstruction zones
- Reuse assessment logs

> Salvage decisions document why reuse is or is not appropriate.

**Price Anchor:**  
- $3k – $30k per salvage system

**R&D Value:**  
Judgment preserved is material saved.

---

## Phase X — Reference Only  
### Instant Full-Scale Build-Out @ Current Market Prices (Non-Binding)

> This phase represents a hypothetical, immediate deployment of complete
> storage, vaulting, logistics, and material-flow infrastructure using current market pricing.
> It is not part of Phases 0–7 and does not represent planned expenditure.
> Included to anchor realism and support future ARGENT-based reinvestment modeling.

### Assumptions
- Multiple workshops
- Long-term material holding (years to decades)
- Apprentice + master redundancy
- Emphasis on resilience over throughput optimization

---

### Order-of-Magnitude Cost Reference

#### Primary Vault Construction & Racking
➡️ **$600k – $1.8M**

#### Controlled Environment Infrastructure
➡️ **$700k – $2.2M**

#### Internal Logistics & Handling Systems
➡️ **$400k – $1.2M**

#### Inventory Sync & Archival Systems
➡️ **$300k – $800k**

---

### Reference Total (SP010 Only)
> **~$2.0M – $6.0M USD**

This excludes:
- External freight logistics
- ERP systems
- Just-in-time supply chains

---

## Contribution Modes (Explicit)
- Storage and racking systems
- Environmental control hardware
- Logistics design expertise
- Inventory resilience systems
- Funding earmarked **SP010 only**

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- ERP dependence
- Fragile efficiency optimization
- External freight modeling
- Disposable storage systems

---

## Status
**Current:** Storage, logistics, and flow doctrine defined and cost-anchored  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Material memory preserved  
✔ Flow bottlenecks eliminated  
✔ Inventory resilient to failure

### Why SP010 Completes Project0001
Anyone can build tools.

Few remember where they put them — or why.

SP010 ensures the workshop remembers.
