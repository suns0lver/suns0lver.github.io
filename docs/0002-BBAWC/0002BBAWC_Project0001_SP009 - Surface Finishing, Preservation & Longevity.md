## SP009 — Surface Finishing, Preservation & Longevity

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP009 governs **endurance over appearance**.

This SP exists to:
- Extend service life under real environments
- Preserve structural truth while allowing wear
- Enable repair without erasure
- Ensure finishes age honestly and predictably

> This SP is about endurance, not gloss.

---

## Phase 0 — Material Degradation Doctrine  
*(Understand failure before preventing it)*

### Foundational Research
- UV exposure and photodegradation
- Moisture cycling and vapor permeability
- Abrasion, impact, and handling wear
- Biological attack (fungi, insects)

> Failure timelines vary by climate, orientation, and maintenance neglect.

**R&D Value:**  
Prevents false confidence in any single finish.

---

## Phase 1 — Traditional Oils, Waxes & Natural Finishes

### Materials
- Linseed (raw / polymerized)
- Tung oil (verified purity)
- Pine tar
- Beeswax and natural wax blends

### Controls
- Finish purity and adulteration verified (especially tung oil)
- Cure times recorded relative to temperature and humidity

**Price Anchor:**  
- $200 – $2,000 per finish system

**R&D Value:**  
Natural finishes trade speed for reversibility.

---

## Phase 2 — Modern Protective Coatings (Evaluation Only)

### Coatings
- Marine varnishes
- Oil-modified urethanes
- Select industrial paints

### Evaluation Criteria
- Performance under exposure
- Reversibility and repairability
- Interaction with underlying material

> Modern coatings are evaluated, not adopted by default.

**Price Anchor:**  
- $500 – $5,000 per evaluation set

**R&D Value:**  
Protection that cannot be reversed becomes a liability.

---

## Phase 3 — Surface Preparation & Texture Control

### Processes
- Planing
- Scraping
- Sanding
- Burnishing

### Controlled Variables
- Surface compression vs cutting
- Fiber sealing vs openness
- Finish absorption behavior

**Price Anchor:**  
- $300 – $3,000 per prep station

**R&D Value:**  
Surface truth determines finish behavior more than chemistry.

---

## Phase 4 — Metal Finishing & Protection

### Techniques
- Bluing
- Browning
- Oil blackening
- Wax protection

### Controls
- Galvanic isolation documented whenever mixed metals are present
- Surface cleanliness verified prior to treatment

**Price Anchor:**  
- $300 – $4,000 per metal finishing setup

**R&D Value:**  
Corrosion paths are often invisible until too late.

---

## Phase 5 — Environmental Exposure Testing

### Testing Regimes
- UV exposure
- Wet/dry cycling
- Freeze/thaw where applicable
- Abrasion and handling simulation

> Test durations are recorded relative to real-world seasonal cycles.

**Price Anchor:**  
- $500 – $6,000 per testing cycle

**R&D Value:**  
Accelerated testing must still map to reality.

---

## Phase 6 — Repairability & Refinish Doctrine

### Principles
- Local repair preferred over full refinish
- Patina preserved where structurally acceptable
- Finish removal methods documented

> Any finish that cannot be repaired in situ is considered hostile to longevity.

**Price Anchor:**  
- $200 – $2,000 per repair kit

**R&D Value:**  
Longevity depends on mercy, not perfection.

---

## Phase 7 — Documentation & Preservation Archive

### Outputs
- Finish recipes
- Application sequences
- Exposure results
- Repair logs and timelines

**Price Anchor:**  
- $200 – $3,000 for archival systems

**R&D Value:**  
Preservation knowledge must outlive the builder.

---

## Phase X — Reference Only  
### Instant Full-Scale Build-Out @ Current Market Prices (Non-Binding)

> This phase represents a hypothetical, immediate deployment of complete
> finishing, preservation, and exposure-testing capability using current market pricing.
> It is not part of Phases 0–7 and does not represent planned expenditure.
> Included to anchor realism and support future ARGENT-based reinvestment modeling.

### Assumptions
- Multiple workshops
- Mixed interior/exterior exposure
- Apprentice + master redundancy
- Immediate readiness prioritized over slow experimentation

### Order-of-Magnitude Cost Reference

#### Natural Finish Systems & Materials
➡️ **$250k – $700k**

#### Modern Coating Evaluation Infrastructure
➡️ **$300k – $900k**

#### Surface Preparation & Metal Protection
➡️ **$350k – $1.0M**

#### Exposure Testing & Documentation
➡️ **$250k – $700k**

---

### Reference Total (SP009 Only)
> **~$1.15M – $3.3M USD**

This excludes:
- Decorative art finishes
- Short-life commercial coatings
- Non-repairable polymer encapsulation

---

## Contribution Modes (Explicit)
- Natural finishing materials
- Exposure testing equipment
- Preservation research
- Documentation systems
- Funding earmarked **SP009 only**

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Cosmetic-only finishes
- Non-repairable encapsulation systems
- Disposable surface treatments

---

## Status
**Current:** Preservation doctrine defined and cost-anchored  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Exposure behavior understood  
✔ Repairability proven  
✔ Knowledge archived

### Why SP009 Matters
Anyone can build something once.

Few build things worth maintaining.
