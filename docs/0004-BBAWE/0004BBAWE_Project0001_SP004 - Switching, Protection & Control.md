## SP004 — Switching, Protection & Control

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP004 exists to decide **when energy is allowed to move — and when it must stop**.

A system without protection is not powerful — it is reckless.
Good protection sacrifices itself cleanly.
Protection that hasn’t failed on purpose cannot be trusted.

This SP establishes authority and restraint over electrical motion.

## Phase 0 — Protection Doctrine & Failure Taxonomy  
*(Before switches click)*

### Core Principles
- Protection precedes control
- Failure is categorized, not improvised
- Silence after failure is a success condition

### Doctrine
- **Fault energy (I²t / let-through energy) treated as a first-class variable**
- Protection designed around worst-case, not nominal conditions
- No reliance on software for primary fault interruption

**R&D Value:**  
If fault energy is not bounded, damage is guaranteed.

---

## Phase 1 — Mechanical Switching Systems  
*(Physical truth)*

### Scope
- Knife switches
- Rotary disconnects
- Load-break switches

### Documentation
- Mechanical endurance cycles logged **alongside electrical ratings**
- Wear treated as electrical risk, not maintenance trivia
- Manual isolation always available

**Price Anchor:**  
- $5k – $80k per mechanical switching tier

**R&D Value:**  
Metal wears before insulation fails.

---

## Phase 2 — Protective Devices (Primary Defense)  
*(Sacrificial first)*

### Devices
- Fuses
- Circuit breakers
- Thermal protectors

### Coordination
- **Selective coordination explicitly verified under worst-case fault current**
- Sacrificial devices designed to fail cleanly and visibly
- Replacement paths defined and stocked

**Price Anchor:**  
- $6k – $120k per protection layer

**R&D Value:**  
Protection must fail before conductors do.

---

## Phase 3 — Relays, Contactors & Isolation  
*(Controlled authority)*

### Systems
- Electromechanical relays
- Contactors
- Safety-rated isolators

### Verification
- **Contact bounce and weld-failure modes documented**
- Isolation states unambiguous and mechanically enforced
- Control voltage loss defaults to safe state

**Price Anchor:**  
- $8k – $140k per relay and isolation system

**R&D Value:**  
Small contact failures cause large fires.

---

## Phase 4 — Arc Suppression & Transient Control  
*(Violence contained)*

### Techniques
- Snubbers
- MOVs
- RC networks
- Physical arc barriers

### Doctrine
- **Transient suppression effectiveness evaluated over component aging**
- Suppression treated as consumable, not permanent
- No exposed arc paths in human-access zones

**Price Anchor:**  
- $7k – $110k per suppression system

**R&D Value:**  
Protection decays quietly unless watched.

---

## Phase 5 — Control Logic & Human Interfaces  
*(Humans must know the truth)*

### Interfaces
- Physical indicators
- Mechanical interlocks
- Minimal logic displays

### Doctrine
- **State ambiguity explicitly forbidden**
  (no unclear “maybe on” indicators)
- Human-visible state always matches electrical reality
- Control logic cannot override physical protection

**Price Anchor:**  
- $4k – $90k per control and interface layer

**R&D Value:**  
Humans act faster than dashboards.

---

## Phase 6 — Fault Injection & Abuse Testing  
*(Trust earned through damage)*

### Testing
- Overcurrent injection
- Short-circuit testing
- Thermal overload

### Doctrine
- **Tests explicitly labeled destructive vs non-destructive**
- Protection evaluated by failure behavior, not survival
- Silent failure modes flagged as critical defects

**Price Anchor:**  
- $6k – $100k per fault testing setup

**R&D Value:**  
Protection that survives everything proves nothing.

---

## Phase 7 — Documentation, Labeling & Training  
*(Memory enforced)*

### Systems
- Physical labeling
- Protection maps
- Training artifacts

### Practice
- **Drill frequency and re-certification intervals defined**
- Protection layouts treated as living documents
- Operator authority boundaries documented explicitly

**Price Anchor:**  
- $3k – $60k per documentation and training system

**R&D Value:**  
Memory fades without rehearsal.

## Phase X — Reference Only  
### Instant NTIPS Protection Infrastructure @ Current Market Prices (Non-Binding)

> This phase represents a hypothetical, immediate deployment of full
> switching, protection, suppression, and fault-testing infrastructure
> using current market pricing.
> It is not part of Phases 0–7 and does not represent planned expenditure.
> Included to anchor realism and support future ARGENT-based reinvestment modeling.

### Assumptions
- Industrial-grade switchgear
- Redundant protection layers
- In-house fault testing
- Immediate readiness prioritized over incremental learning

### Order-of-Magnitude Cost Reference

#### Switching, Protection & Suppression Systems

#### Testing, Training & Documentation
➡️ **$600k – $1.4M**

### Reference Total (SP004 Only)
> **~$1.7M – $4.3M USD**

This excludes:
- Power conversion electronics
- Energy storage systems
- Measurement instrumentation
- Grid-scale orchestration

---

## Contribution Modes (Explicit)
- Switchgear and protective devices
- Arc suppression systems
- Fault testing infrastructure
- Training and documentation tooling
- Funding earmarked **SP004 only**

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Power generation
- Conversion topologies
- Energy storage
- Measurement instrumentation

## Status
**Current:** Protection authority defined and cost-anchored  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Fault energy bounded  
✔ Failure contained  
✔ Humans protected

### Why SP004 Matters
Power without restraint burns everything it touches.

SP004 teaches electricity when to stop.
