## SP010 — NTIPS Integration & Grid-Scale Systems

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP010 exists to **compose electricity into a self-aware system**.

This is electricity as an organism, not a utility.
If it can’t wake itself, it’s not sovereign.
Total power demands total restraint.
Power exists to serve purpose.

## Phase 0 — System Ontology & Power Topology  
*(Before anything connects)*

### Core Principles
- Authority precedes energy flow
- Topology defines behavior
- Sovereignty requires explicit custody

### Doctrine
- **Authority boundaries explicitly defined between power domains**
  (what may shut down what, and under which conditions)
- No hidden kill paths
- Topology diagrams treated as control documents

**R&D Value:**  
If authority is unclear, failure chooses for you.

---

## Phase 1 — Generation Inputs (Multi-Source)  
*(Inputs before memory)*

### Scope
- Solar
- Wind
- Hydro
- Thermal
- External grid tie (bounded)

### Documentation
- **Source intermittency profiles explicitly documented**
- Failure characteristics logged per source
- Inputs treated as probabilistic, not guaranteed

**Price Anchor:**  
- $40k – $500k per input characterization tier

**R&D Value:**  
Inputs lie by omission.

---

## Phase 2 — Storage Orchestration Layer  
*(The Memory Core)*

### Scope
- Hierarchical storage tiers
- Time-domain arbitration
- Conflict resolution

### Doctrine
- **Explicit conflict resolution rules when storage tiers disagree**
- Memory arbitrates; it does not average
- Storage states logged as narrative, not snapshots

**Price Anchor:**  
- $60k – $700k per orchestration layer

**R&D Value:**  
Memory without arbitration is confusion.

---

## Phase 3 — Conversion & Distribution Spine  
*(The Circulatory System)*

### Scope
- High-level conversion paths
- Distribution buses
- Interconnect points

### Documentation
- **Latency budgets defined per conversion hop**
- Loss accumulation tracked end-to-end
- Distribution treated as dynamic, not static

**Price Anchor:**  
- $80k – $900k per spine configuration

**R&D Value:**  
Delay is a hidden cost.

---

## Phase 4 — Load Intelligence & Prioritization  
*(Nervous System)*

### Load Classes
- **Life-critical**
- **Mission-critical**
- **Operational**
- **Optional**

### Doctrine
- **Explicit definitions enforced for each load class**
- Priority inversion explicitly prohibited
- Load shedding is intentional, not reactive

**Price Anchor:**  
- $50k – $600k per load intelligence layer

**R&D Value:**  
Ambiguity here kills trust.

---

## Phase 5 — Redundancy, Islanding & Black-Start  
*(Survival Logic)*

### Scope
- Islanding strategies
- Black-start procedures
- Partial recovery handling

### Doctrine
- **Failure modes for partial black-start success explicitly documented**
- Half-awake states treated as hazardous
- Survival logic tested under deprivation

**Price Anchor:**  
- $70k – $850k per survival system

**R&D Value:**  
Waking up halfway is dangerous.

---

## Phase 6 — Safety, Protection & System-Wide Kill Authority  
*(Absolute Control)*

### Scope
- Global shutdown mechanisms
- Interlock hierarchies
- Emergency authority invocation

### Doctrine
- **Explicit custody rules for who/what may invoke global kill authority**
- Kill authority auditable and testable
- No silent overrides

**Price Anchor:**  
- $40k – $500k per safety and authority layer

**R&D Value:**  
Absolute power requires explicit custody.

---

## Phase 7 — Monitoring, Telemetry & Awareness  
*(Consciousness Layer)*

### Scope
- Telemetry aggregation
- Anomaly detection
- State awareness

### Doctrine
- **Clear distinction between anomaly detection and anomaly response**
- Awareness does not imply action
- Consciousness logged, not assumed

**Price Anchor:**  
- $60k – $700k per monitoring and awareness platform

**R&D Value:**  
Seeing is not acting.

---

## Phase 8 — Cross-Domain Power Handoff  
*(Integration Ports)*

### Scope
- Inter-domain interfaces
- Power exchange protocols
- Isolation enforcement

### Doctrine
- **Handshake protocols require state-of-health validation before transfer**
- Power does not cross blind
- Handoff failures treated as learning events

**Price Anchor:**  
- $30k – $400k per handoff interface

**R&D Value:**  
Trust requires verification.

---

## Phase 9 — Documentation, Ritual & Stewardship  
*(The Living Record)*

### Scope
- Operational doctrine
- Stewardship practices
- Succession planning

### Doctrine
- **Explicit stewardship succession rules defined**
- Systems outlive individuals
- Rituals preserve intent

**Price Anchor:**  
- $10k – $120k per documentation and stewardship layer

**R&D Value:**  
Memory without succession decays.

---

## Phase X — Reference Only  
### Instant NTIPS Sovereign Grid-Orchestration Capability @ Current Market Prices (Non-Binding)

> This phase represents a hypothetical, immediate deployment of a fully
> sovereign, self-orchestrating NTIPS power system using current market pricing.
> It is not part of Phases 0–9 and does not represent planned expenditure.
> Included to anchor realism and support future ARGENT-based reinvestment modeling.

### Assumptions
- Multi-source generation inputs
- Tiered storage orchestration
- Redundant distribution spines
- Full monitoring, protection, and kill authority
- Immediate readiness prioritized over incremental learning

---

### Order-of-Magnitude Cost Reference

#### Orchestration, Distribution & Control Systems
➡️ **$4.5M – $12.0M**

#### Monitoring, Safety & Stewardship Infrastructure
➡️ **$2.0M – $5.5M**

---

### Reference Total (SP010 Only)
> **~$6.5M – $17.5M USD**

This excludes:
- Power generation assets
- Energy storage hardware
- Component-level conversion
- Regulatory certification
- Commercial utility integration

---

## Contribution Modes (Explicit)
- Orchestration and control systems
- Telemetry and monitoring platforms
- Safety and authority enforcement mechanisms
- Documentation and stewardship tooling
- Funding earmarked **SP010 only**

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- National grid operations
- Commercial utility scaling
- Regulatory compliance certification
- Extractive power sales

---

## Status
**Current:** Sovereign power orchestration doctrine defined and cost-anchored  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Authority explicit  
✔ Survival bounded  
✔ Awareness preserved

### Why SP010 Matters
This is not about having power.

SP010 decides whether power knows what it is doing.
