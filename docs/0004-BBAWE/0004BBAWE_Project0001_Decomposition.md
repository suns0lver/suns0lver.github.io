## NTIPS — Back-to-Basics Archaic Workshop: Electricity

### Domain Framing (Non-Negotiable)
Electricity is **physical**, not abstract.

Loss matters. Resistance is entropy.
Resonance reveals truth — bad systems scream, good ones hum.

This domain treats electrical power as **craft**, not commodity.
This is not consumer electronics. This is power as craft.

---

## Mission
Design, build, and operate a **sovereign, legible, repairable electrical ecosystem**
rooted in first principles, visible physics, and disciplined safety.

NTIPS exists to:
- Make energy **understandable**
- Make loss **visible**
- Make failure **non-catastrophic**
- Make power **ownable**

---

## Core Doctrine
- Electricity must be **seen, measured, and respected**
- Every conductor, component, and conversion step carries memory
- Silence is a success condition
- Safety precedes throughput
- Sovereignty requires islanding capability

---

## Spatial & Architectural Principles
- Creepage and clearance drive layout geometry
- Zones defined by voltage, current, and failure mode
- No mixed-intent spaces (measurement ≠ generation ≠ storage)
- Human access paths never cross high-energy fault paths

---

## Project Decomposition

### SP001 — Philosophy, Layout & Flow  
*Intent before copper*

- Spatial zoning by voltage, current, and failure class
- Creepage and clearance treated as architectural drivers
- Physical visibility of energy paths enforced
- Human safety corridors prioritized over compactness

---

### SP002 — Conductors, Wire & Cable  
*Loss is surface-level*

- Copper, aluminum, and specialty conductors evaluated
- Oxidation, annealing state, and surface finish logged as loss variables
- Mechanical strain relief treated as electrical integrity
- Terminations documented as first-class failure points

---

### SP003 — Passive Components  
*Memory without motion*

- Resistors, capacitors, inductors treated as energy shapers
- Temperature coefficient tracked as a primary variable
- Drift logged as degradation, not noise
- Aging behavior documented longitudinally

---

### SP004 — Switching, Protection & Control  
*Failure must be faster than damage*

- Mechanical and solid-state switching systems
- Protection devices coordinated by **failure-speed hierarchy**
  (microseconds → milliseconds → seconds)
- Fault isolation favored over brute interruption
- Manual override paths always present

---

### SP005 — Power Conversion & Conditioning  
*Efficiency without honesty is lying*

- AC/DC, DC/DC, and frequency conversion systems
- Conversion efficiency always logged **alongside harmonic profile**
- Ripple treated as stress, not artifact
- Thermal behavior documented under load variance

---

### SP006 — Energy Storage  
*Time is the real capacity*

- Chemical, mechanical, and field-based storage systems
- Cycle life and calendar life tracked separately
- Degradation curves documented before deployment
- Storage treated as a sovereignty buffer, not a tank

---

### SP007 — Superconductors & Exotic Conductance  
*Restraint over hype*

- Exotic conductance explored only under explicit justification
- Quench detection treated as a **primary safety system**
- Cryogenic interfaces isolated from general workflow
- No deployment claims without failure characterization

---

### SP008 — Measurement, Instrumentation & Signal  
*Truth requires calibration*

- Voltage, current, frequency, phase, and noise measurement
- Instrument calibration history preserved as **data**, not metadata
- Measurement tools treated as aging systems
- Signal paths physically separated from power paths

---

### SP009 — Safety, Failure & Abuse Testing  
*Electricity remembers*

- Overcurrent, overvoltage, thermal, and environmental abuse tests
- Post-failure **system silence verification** required
  (no latent charge, no stored field, no thermal debt)
- Failures documented as system events, not component blame

---

### SP010 — NTIPS Integration & Grid-Scale Systems  
*Sovereignty practiced*

- Islanded microgrid operation
- Intentional islanding drills documented and repeated
- Grid-tie treated as optional, not assumed
- Black-start capability required

---

## Cross-Domain Interfaces
- **BITS** — provenance, audit, and lifecycle memory
- **Qtπ** — orchestration, scheduling, and visibility (not abstraction)
- **MIFF / SPANCL / MAM** — physical manufacturing interfaces only

---

## Explicit Exclusions
- Consumer electronics
- Black-box power supplies
- Undocumented disposal
- JIT fragility
- Magical thinking

---

## Status
**Current:** Domain doctrine locked and decomposed  
**Next:** SP-level documentation (SP001 → SP010)

---

### Why NTIPS Matters
Electricity is the quiet ruler of everything downstream.

NTIPS ensures it stays honest.
