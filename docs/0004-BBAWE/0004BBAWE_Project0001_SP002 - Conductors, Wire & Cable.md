## SP002 — Conductors, Wire & Cable

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
Wire is not a commodity here. It is a **designed component with memory**.

Geometry beats material at frequency.
Most electrical failures occur at joints, not runs.
Anonymous wire is a liability.
You cannot fake resistance.

This SP makes loss visible, accountable, and intentional.

## Phase 0 — Conduction Doctrine & Loss Modeling  
*(Physics before copper)*

### Core Models
- DC conduction
- Low-frequency AC conduction
- High-frequency / RF behavior

### Doctrine
- Loss models explicitly separated for **DC**, **low-frequency AC**, and **RF** regimes
- Skin effect, proximity effect, and thermal rise modeled independently

**R&D Value:**  
Models that bleed across regimes lie quietly.

---

## Phase 1 — Conductor Materials (Benchmark & Research)  
*(Material before geometry)*

### Materials
- Copper (various purities)
- Aluminum (structural vs electrical grades)
- Specialty conductors (silver, alloys, composites)

### Documentation
- Purity, grain structure, and annealing state logged alongside conductivity
- Mechanical fatigue behavior tracked with electrical metrics

**Price Anchor:**  
- $2k – $40k per material library tier

**R&D Value:**  
Bulk conductivity hides mechanical truth.

---

## Phase 2 — Wire Drawing, Forming & Geometry Control  
*(Geometry before bundles)*

### Controls
- Diameter
- Ovality
- Surface finish

### Doctrine
- Diameter tolerance defined relative to **intended frequency and current density**
- Drawing defects logged as electrical risks, not cosmetic flaws

**Price Anchor:**  
- $3k – $60k per drawing and forming setup

**R&D Value:**  
Small geometry errors scale brutally with frequency.

---

## Phase 3 — Stranding, Litz & Bundle Architectures  
*(Bundles before insulation)*

### Architectures
- Solid core
- Stranded
- Litz wire
- Hybrid bundles

### Documentation
- Twist pitch documented as a function of **frequency band**, not aesthetics
- Strand count and lay direction recorded

**Price Anchor:**  
- $2k – $50k per bundling system

**R&D Value:**  
Folklore cabling is expensive noise.

---

## Phase 4 — Insulation & Dielectric Systems  
*(Insulation before armor)*

### Materials
- PVC
- PTFE
- Silicone
- Natural dielectrics (where justified)

### Metrics
- Breakdown voltage
- Dielectric constant
- Dielectric loss tangent tracked **alongside** breakdown voltage

**Price Anchor:**  
- $2k – $45k per insulation system

**R&D Value:**  
High voltage success can still be electrically loud.

---

## Phase 5 — Shielding, Jacketing & Environmental Armor  
*(Armor before joints)*

### Systems
- Braided shields
- Foil shields
- Hybrid approaches

### Doctrine
- Shield termination geometry documented explicitly
- Environmental exposure limits logged

**Price Anchor:**  
- $2k – $40k per shielding and jacketing system

**R&D Value:**  
Most shields fail at their ends.

---

## Phase 6 — Termination, Joining & Contact Physics  
*(Joints before abuse)*

### Techniques
- Crimping
- Soldering
- Mechanical lugs
- Welded joints

### Verification
- Contact resistance logged over time and after thermal cycling
- Joint failures treated as system failures

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1k – $30k per termination system

**R&D Value:**  
Joints age faster than wire.

---

## Phase 7 — Testing, Rating & Abuse Scenarios  
*(Abuse before memory)*

### Tests
- Thermal overload
- Flex fatigue
- Environmental exposure

### Doctrine
- Abuse tests explicitly labeled as **destructive** or **non-destructive**
- Ratings derived from failure, not optimism

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1k – $20k per testing setup

**R&D Value:**  
Ratings without abuse are marketing.

---

## Phase 8 — Cataloging, Marking & Provenance  
*(No anonymous conductors)*

### Systems
- Physical tags
- Batch identifiers
- Digital records

### Lifecycle
- Retirement criteria defined per conductor class
- End-of-life logged, not discarded silently

**Price Anchor:**  
- $500 – $15k per provenance system

**R&D Value:**  
Memory includes knowing when to stop trusting a wire.

---

## Phase X — Reference Only  
### Instant NTIPS Conductor Capability @ Current Market Prices (Non-Binding)

> This phase represents a hypothetical, immediate deployment of full
> conductor fabrication, testing, and provenance infrastructure using
> current market pricing.
> It is not part of Phases 0–8 and does not represent planned expenditure.
> Included to anchor realism and support future ARGENT-based reinvestment modeling.

### Assumptions
- Mixed DC / AC / RF capability
- In-house termination and testing
- Apprentice + master redundancy
- Immediate readiness prioritized over incremental learning

---

### Order-of-Magnitude Cost Reference

#### Conductor Fabrication & Geometry Control
➡️ **$800k – $2.1M**

#### Insulation, Shielding & Termination Systems
➡️ **$700k – $1.9M**

#### Testing, Provenance & Documentation
➡️ **$400k – $1.0M**

### Reference Total (SP002 Only)
> **~$1.9M – $5.0M USD**

This excludes:
- Passive components
- Switching and protection
- Power conversion
- Energy storage

---

## Contribution Modes (Explicit)
- Conductor materials and fabrication tooling
- Insulation and shielding systems
- Termination and testing equipment
- Provenance and documentation systems
- Funding earmarked **SP002 only**

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Passive components
- Switching and protection
- Conversion electronics
- Storage chemistry

---

## Status
**Current:** Conductor doctrine defined and cost-anchored  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Loss visible  
✔ Geometry accountable  
✔ Joints honest

### Why SP002 Matters
Copper hides mistakes better than steel.

SP002 makes them visible.
