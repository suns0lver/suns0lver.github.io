## SP005 — Power Conversion & Conditioning

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
Good power doesn’t announce itself. It just works.

This SP is refinement, not generation.
Raw electricity is loud. Conditioned electricity whispers.

SP005 exists to civilize power so downstream systems can think, measure, and endure.

## Phase 0 — Power Quality Doctrine  
*(Before rectifiers hum)*

### Core Principles
- Power quality is behavioral, not nominal
- Noise is a symptom, not a side effect
- Silence is a success condition

### Doctrine
- **Audible noise explicitly correlated to electrical noise sources**
- Electrical, thermal, and acoustic signatures logged together

**R&D Value:**  
If you can hear it, the system is already lying.

---

## Phase 1 — Rectification & Fundamental Conversion  
*(AC becomes DC honestly)*

### Scope
- Diode rectification
- Synchronous rectification
- Hybrid approaches

### Documentation
- **Reverse recovery behavior documented for rectifier devices**
- Switching edges treated as noise injection events
- Thermal rise logged per topology

**Price Anchor:**  
- $5k – $80k per rectification research tier

**R&D Value:**  
Most noise is born where polarity changes.

---

## Phase 2 — Voltage Transformation & Isolation  
*(Power changes scale)*

### Systems
- Line-frequency transformers
- High-frequency transformers
- Isolation stages

### Design Variables
- **Leakage inductance and interwinding capacitance treated as design variables**
- Isolation rated electrically and mechanically

**Price Anchor:**  
- $10k – $160k per transformation and isolation system

**R&D Value:**  
Transformers whisper or scream based on geometry.

---

## Phase 3 — Regulation & Stabilization  
*(Control replaces hope)*

### Techniques
- Linear regulation
- Switching regulation
- Hybrid regulation

### Verification
- **Transient response evaluated under worst-case load step**
- Control loop stability validated under temperature extremes

**Price Anchor:**  
- $12k – $200k per regulation platform

**R&D Value:**  
Control loops lie when pampered.

---

## Phase 4 — Filtering, Smoothing & Harmonic Control  
*(Rough edges removed)*

### Methods
- LC filtering
- Active filtering
- Harmonic traps

### Doctrine
- **Filter resonance behavior characterized alongside attenuation**
- Filters treated as dynamic systems, not static blocks

**Price Anchor:**  
- $8k – $140k per filtering and harmonic control system

**R&D Value:**  
Filters can oscillate emotionally if ignored.

---

## Phase 5 — Frequency Control & Inversion  
*(Time disciplined)*

### Scope
- Inverters
- Frequency synthesizers
- Phase-locked systems

### Metrics
- **Phase noise and jitter tracked as first-class metrics**
- Frequency accuracy evaluated with load coupling

**Price Anchor:**  
- $10k – $180k per frequency control system

**R&D Value:**  
Accurate frequency can still be ugly.

---

## Phase 6 — Load Interaction & Conditioning  
*(Power meets reality)*

### Load Classes
- Resistive
- Inductive
- Nonlinear
- Pulsed

### Doctrine
- **Load classification explicitly documented**
- Conditioning tuned to worst-behaved load, not average case

**Price Anchor:**  
- $6k – $120k per load interaction platform

**R&D Value:**  
Loads lie about who they are.

---

## Phase 7 — Measurement, Validation & Burn-In  
*(Trust earned over time)*

### Validation
- Long-duration burn-in
- Thermal soak
- Noise stability tracking

### Doctrine
- **Burn-in failures categorized by root cause, not symptom**
- Silent degradations flagged as critical

**Price Anchor:**  
- $10k – $160k per validation and burn-in system

**R&D Value:**  
Smoke is not a diagnosis.

---

## Phase 8 — Documentation, Standards & Reuse  
*(Silence preserved)*

### Systems
- Design records
- Performance envelopes
- Aging curves

### Reuse Doctrine
- **Reuse criteria explicitly tied to noise, thermal, and aging envelopes**
- No redeployment without re-validation

**Price Anchor:**  
- $3k – $60k per documentation and standards system

**R&D Value:**  
Reuse without bounds is drift.

---

## Phase X — Reference Only  
### Instant NTIPS Power Conditioning Capability @ Current Market Prices (Non-Binding)

> This phase represents a hypothetical, immediate deployment of complete
> power conversion, conditioning, validation, and documentation capability
> using current market pricing.
> It is not part of Phases 0–8 and does not represent planned expenditure.
> Included to anchor realism and support future ARGENT-based reinvestment modeling.

### Assumptions
- Industrial-grade conversion platforms
- Redundant validation systems
- Long-duration burn-in capability
- Immediate readiness prioritized over incremental design cycles

---

### Order-of-Magnitude Cost Reference

#### Conversion, Regulation & Filtering Systems
➡️ **$1.4M – $3.6M**

#### Measurement, Validation & Burn-In Infrastructure
➡️ **$900k – $2.2M**

---

### Reference Total (SP005 Only)
> **~$2.3M – $5.8M USD**

This excludes:
- Energy storage systems
- Switching and protection
- Passive component fabrication
- Grid-scale orchestration

---

## Contribution Modes (Explicit)
- Power conversion and conditioning hardware
- Measurement and burn-in infrastructure
- Control and regulation research
- Documentation and standards tooling
- Funding earmarked **SP005 only**

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Energy storage chemistry
- Primary switching and protection
- Passive component fabrication
- Grid orchestration

---

## Status
**Current:** Power refinement doctrine defined and cost-anchored  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Noise bounded  
✔ Transients controlled  
✔ Power civilized

### Why SP005 Matters
Civilization begins when power stops shouting.

SP005 teaches electricity to whisper.
