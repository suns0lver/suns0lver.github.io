## SP006 — Energy Storage

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
Generation is power.  
Storage is freedom.

Storage without management is a countdown.
Stored energy must fail quietly.

This SP is potential, not flow.  
SP006 is Suns0lver learning to wait.

## Phase 0 — Storage Doctrine & Timescale Mapping  
*(Before cells charge)*

### Core Principles
- Storage exists to **buy time**, not impress dashboards
- Capacity without control is liability
- Silence after failure is mandatory

### Timescale Mapping
- **Response time** (how fast energy is available)
- **Sustain time** (how long energy can be delivered)
- **Recovery time** (how long before system is trustworthy again)

These are treated as **independent variables**, not one metric.

**R&D Value:**  
Fast systems are not reserves. Large systems are not agile.

---

## Phase 1 — Electrochemical Storage (Batteries)  
*(Chemistry remembers)*

### Scope
- Lithium-ion variants
- Sodium-based systems
- Lead-acid (baseline truth)
- Experimental chemistries (gated)

### Documentation
- Energy density
- Power density
- **Calendar aging tracked independently of cycle aging**
- Thermal runaway thresholds logged

**Price Anchor:**  
- $20k – $400k per battery research and test tier

**R&D Value:**  
Most batteries die of time, not use.

---

## Phase 2 — Capacitive Storage (Fast Energy)  
*(Truth without patience)*

### Scope
- Supercapacitors
- Hybrid capacitor systems

### Documentation
- Charge/discharge curves
- ESR behavior
- **Voltage droop behavior documented as a first-class limitation**

**Price Anchor:**  
- $10k – $180k per capacitive storage platform

**R&D Value:**  
Capacitors tell the truth immediately — and stop immediately.

---

## Phase 3 — Mechanical–Electrical Hybrid Storage  
*(Mass remembers differently)*

### Systems
- Flywheels
- Counterweight systems
- Motor–generator hybrids

### Documentation
- Round-trip efficiency
- **Bearing losses and standby losses logged explicitly**
- Failure containment behavior recorded

**Price Anchor:**  
- $40k – $600k per mechanical storage system

**R&D Value:**  
Mechanical memory leaks energy differently than chemistry.

---

## Phase 4 — Thermal–Electrical Coupled Storage  
*(Heat as delayed motion)*

### Systems
- Phase-change materials
- Molten salt (where applicable)
- Thermal mass storage

### Metrics
- Capture efficiency
- **Thermal round-trip efficiency tracked**
- Thermal decay curves logged

**Price Anchor:**  
- $30k – $500k per thermal storage system

**R&D Value:**  
Heat lies in the return trip.

---

## Phase 5 — Battery Management & Control Systems  
*(Guardianship, not optimization)*

### Scope
- Battery management systems (BMS)
- Charge controllers
- Protection logic

### Doctrine
- **BMS failure modes explicitly tested as first-order risks**
- Control logic defaults to safe, silent states
- No optimization without protection

**Price Anchor:**  
- $15k – $250k per management and control platform

**R&D Value:**  
Management failure is catastrophic.

---

## Phase 6 — Safety, Containment & Abuse Testing  
*(Stored violence respected)*

### Tests
- Overcharge
- Thermal abuse
- Mechanical damage
- Environmental stress

### Doctrine
- **Post-failure silence verification required**
  (no latent heat, pressure, or charge)
- Containment integrity validated after events

**Price Anchor:**  
- $25k – $350k per abuse testing system

**R&D Value:**  
Stored energy must stop cleanly.

---

## Phase 7 — Degradation, Aging & End-of-Life  
*(Time accounted for)*

### Tracking
- Capacity fade
- Internal resistance growth
- Thermal behavior drift

### Lifecycle Doctrine
- **Second-life eligibility criteria explicitly defined**
- End-of-life logged, not hidden

**Price Anchor:**  
- $10k – $180k per aging and lifecycle tracking system

**R&D Value:**  
Reuse without rules is denial.

---

## Phase 8 — Integration, Handoff & Provenance  
*(Trust travels)*

### Integration Rules
- Storage classified by state-of-health
- **State-of-health thresholds required for cross-domain handoff**
- Provenance preserved across redeployment

**Price Anchor:**  
- $5k – $90k per integration and tracking system

**R&D Value:**  
Optimism does not travel across domains.

---

## Phase X — Reference Only  
### Instant NTIPS Energy Storage Capability @ Current Market Prices (Non-Binding)

> This phase represents a hypothetical, immediate deployment of complete
> multi-modal energy storage, testing, containment, and lifecycle management
> capability using current market pricing.
> It is not part of Phases 0–8 and does not represent planned expenditure.
> Included to anchor realism and support future ARGENT-based reinvestment modeling.

### Assumptions
- Mixed chemical, mechanical, and thermal storage
- Full safety containment
- Long-duration aging labs
- Immediate readiness prioritized over incremental learning

### Order-of-Magnitude Cost Reference

#### Storage Systems & Containment
➡️ **$2.0M – $5.5M**

#### Management, Testing & Aging Infrastructure
➡️ **$1.2M – $3.1M**

---

### Reference Total (SP006 Only)
> **~$3.2M – $8.6M USD**

This excludes:
- Power conversion electronics
- Switching and protection
- Grid-scale orchestration
- Generation assets

---

## Contribution Modes (Explicit)
- Energy storage hardware
- Safety containment systems
- Management and control platforms
- Aging and lifecycle testing equipment
- Funding earmarked **SP006 only**

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Power generation
- Primary conversion electronics
- Switching and protection
- Grid orchestration

---

## Status
**Current:** Storage sovereignty doctrine defined and cost-anchored  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Time bought  
✔ Risk bounded  
✔ Silence enforced

### Why SP006 Matters
Anyone can make power.

SP006 decides whether you have time to think.
