## SP001 — Philosophy, Layout & Flow

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP001 exists to **impose order on electricity before it moves**.

Electricity punishes sloppy layouts instantly.
This SP is order before current.

Layout is not convenience. It is safety, truth, and respect made physical.

---

## Phase 0 — Electrical Doctrine & Zoning  
*(Before benches, before power)*

### Core Principles
- Electricity is physical and directional
- Voltage tiers define space
- Fault paths are treated as real movement, not abstraction

### Zoning Doctrine
- Creepage and clearance requirements explicitly mapped **per voltage tier**
- Zones defined by:
  - Maximum voltage
  - Available fault current
  - Failure mode (arc, thermal, magnetic)

**R&D Value:**  
If electrons are confused, people will be injured.

---

## Phase 1 — Physical Layout Infrastructure  
*(Walls before wires)*

### Infrastructure
- Floors, walls, and ceilings rated for electrical fault events
- Non-conductive separation where required
- Clear egress paths maintained under all operating states

### Structural Doctrine
- Transformer and rack anchor points rated for **fault-event forces**, not just static load
- No overhead routing above human work zones

**Price Anchor:**  
- $20k – $250k per electrical layout zone

**R&D Value:**  
Electric faults move mass. Layout must survive motion.

---

## Phase 2 — Workbenches & Sacred Surfaces  
*(Human–machine boundary)*

### Bench Types
- Floating benches
- Bonded benches
- Isolated measurement benches

### Grounding Doctrine
- Bench grounding schemes documented per bench type
  (floating vs bonded vs hybrid)
- Bench surfaces treated as controlled interfaces, not furniture

**Price Anchor:**  
- $5k – $60k per bench system

**R&D Value:**  
A lying bench lies to the instrument and the human.

---

## Phase 3 — Power Distribution & Isolation Backbone  
*(Energy must know where it is allowed to go)*

### Systems
- Main distribution panels
- Local disconnects
- Lockout/tagout interfaces

### Visibility Doctrine
- Isolation state visibly indicated **at point of use**, not only at panel
- No hidden energized paths

**Price Anchor:**  
- $15k – $200k per distribution backbone

**R&D Value:**  
If power status must be guessed, the design has failed.

---

## Phase 4 — Grounding, Shielding & Noise Control  
*(Truth infrastructure)*

### Grounding Systems
- Star grounds
- Local reference grounds
- Shield bonding paths

### Verification
- Ground impedance periodically measured and logged
- Shield continuity verified after layout changes

**Price Anchor:**  
- $10k – $120k per grounding and shielding zone

**R&D Value:**  
A drifting ground corrupts truth quietly.

---

## Phase 5 — Lighting, Visibility & Human Awareness  
*(See the danger before it acts)*

### Lighting Systems
- Task lighting
- Ambient lighting
- Emergency lighting

### Evaluation
- Lighting evaluated under **fault conditions**
  (arc flash, smoke, glare)
- No shadow zones over energized equipment

**Price Anchor:**  
- $8k – $80k per lighting zone

**R&D Value:**  
Visibility is a safety system.

---

## Phase 6 — Safety, Containment & Emergency Control  
*(Failure must be survivable)*

### Systems
- Emergency shutoffs
- Energy dump paths
- Arc containment

### Practice Doctrine
- Emergency power dump paths **tested and logged as drills**
- Safety systems exercised, not assumed

**Price Anchor:**  
- $12k – $150k per safety zone

**R&D Value:**  
Safety that is not practiced is theater.

---

## Phase 7 — Instrumentation Staging & Measurement Sanctum  
*(Silence preserved)*

### Measurement Zones
- Physically isolated from power experimentation
- Shielded from switching noise
- Treated as quiet rooms

### Doctrine
- Measurement zones explicitly **forbidden** from power experimentation
- Instrument access controlled and logged

**Price Anchor:**  
- $6k – $90k per measurement sanctum

**R&D Value:**  
Measurement requires silence to tell the truth.

---

## Phase 8 — Documentation, Signal Language & Memory  
*(The space learns)*

### Outputs
- Layout maps
- Zoning diagrams
- Fault path annotations
- Resonance observations

### Memory Doctrine
- Resonance logs linked directly to layout revisions
- Layout changes treated as experiments with recorded outcomes

**Price Anchor:**  
- $3k – $40k per documentation system

**R&D Value:**  
A space that remembers improves itself.

---

## Phase X — Reference Only  
### Instant NTIPS Layout Infrastructure @ Current Market Prices (Non-Binding)

> This phase represents a hypothetical, immediate deployment of complete
> NTIPS-compliant electrical layout and zoning infrastructure using current
> market pricing.
> It is not part of Phases 0–8 and does not represent planned expenditure.
> Included to anchor realism and support future ARGENT-based reinvestment modeling.

### Assumptions
- Full zoning separation
- Redundant safety systems
- Measurement sanctums isolated
- Immediate readiness prioritized over incremental buildout

---

### Order-of-Magnitude Cost Reference

#### Structural Layout & Zoning Infrastructure
➡️ **$900k – $2.4M**

#### Safety, Grounding & Visibility Systems
➡️ **$700k – $1.8M**

---

### Reference Total (SP001 Only)
> **~$1.6M – $4.2M USD**

This excludes:
- Conductors and cabling
- Components and conversion systems
- Energy storage
- Grid-scale integration

---

## Contribution Modes (Explicit)
- Architectural layout materials
- Safety and containment systems
- Grounding and shielding infrastructure
- Documentation and signal-logging tooling
- Funding earmarked **SP001 only**

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Wire fabrication
- Component selection
- Energy storage
- Grid orchestration

---

## Status
**Current:** Electrical order doctrine defined and cost-anchored  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Space zoned  
✔ Humans protected  
✔ Current disciplined

### Why SP001 Matters
Electricity does not forgive confusion.

SP001 ensures clarity exists before power ever flows.
