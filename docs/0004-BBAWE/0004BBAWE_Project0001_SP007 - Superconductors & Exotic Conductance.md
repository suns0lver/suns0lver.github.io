## SP007 — Superconductors & Exotic Conductance

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
Superconductors are not magic.  
They are **conditional truth**.

Silence is earned through fragility, cost, and restraint.
This SP is research with humility, not futurism cosplay.

---

## Phase 0 — Superconductivity Doctrine & Boundaries  
*(Before anything gets cold)*

### Core Principles
- Superconductivity exists only within a bounded physical surface
- Zero resistance does not mean zero risk
- Silence is conditional, not permanent

### Doctrine
- **Critical surface (Tc–Bc–Ic) treated as a 3-D boundary**, not independent limits
- Operation inside the surface is required, not optional
- Any excursion outside the surface is treated as failure, not tolerance

**R&D Value:**  
Below Tc is not “safe” unless B and I agree.

---

## Phase 1 — Benchmark Materials (Known Quantities)  
*(Truth before novelty)*

### Materials
- Low-temperature superconductors (NbTi, Nb₃Sn)
- High-temperature superconductors (YBCO, BSCCO)

### Documentation
- Critical temperature, field, and current density
- **Mechanical brittleness and handling risk logged alongside electrical performance**
- Degradation under handling explicitly recorded

**Price Anchor:**  
- $25k – $250k per benchmark material tier

**R&D Value:**  
HTS materials fail with fingers, not equations.

---

## Phase 2 — Cryogenic & Thermal Control Systems  
*(Cold is a system, not a setting)*

### Systems
- Liquid cryogens
- Cryocoolers
- Thermal shielding and vacuum systems

### Safety Doctrine
- **Cooldown and warm-up rates logged as first-class safety variables**
- Thermal gradients treated as stress multipliers
- Loss of cooling treated as an emergency, not an event

**Price Anchor:**  
- $60k – $600k per cryogenic control system

**R&D Value:**  
Thermal shock kills quietly.

---

## Phase 3 — Sample Handling, Mounting & Geometry  
*(Fields move matter)*

### Scope
- Sample fixtures
- Mechanical supports
- Strain-relief structures

### Doctrine
- **Lorentz-force-induced motion explicitly considered in mounting design**
- Geometry treated as a mechanical and electrical variable
- No rigid mounting without compliance modeling

**Price Anchor:**  
- $15k – $180k per mounting and handling system

**R&D Value:**  
Magnetic fields apply force, not just theory.

---

## Phase 4 — Measurement & Characterization  
*(Near-zero invites self-deception)*

### Measurement
- Four-wire resistance
- Magnetic field mapping
- Thermal monitoring

### Doctrine
- **Measurement floor and noise limits documented before interpreting “zero”**
- Instrument drift treated as data
- Silence verified, not assumed

**Price Anchor:**  
- $20k – $300k per measurement and characterization setup

**R&D Value:**  
Near-zero is where lies feel comfortable.

---

## Phase 5 — Quench Detection & Protection  
*(Failure must arrive loudly)*

### Systems
- Voltage taps
- Thermal sensors
- Rapid discharge paths

### Doctrine
- **Quench propagation velocity treated as a design variable**
- Detection speed paired with energy extraction speed
- Quench events logged as primary data, not accidents

**Price Anchor:**  
- $30k – $450k per quench detection and protection system

**R&D Value:**  
Detection without response is decoration.

---

## Phase 6 — Exotic Conductance Exploration (Bounded)  
*(Curiosity fenced)*

### Scope
- Novel materials
- Unconventional geometries
- Edge-case phenomena

### Doctrine
- **Explicit negative-result logging required**
- No extrapolation without replication
- Curiosity bounded by safety envelopes

**Price Anchor:**  
- $20k – $200k per exploratory research tier

**R&D Value:**  
Dead ends are data.

---

## Phase 7 — Integration Thought Experiments  
*(No scaling yet)*

### Activities
- Conceptual integration studies
- Failure-mode analysis
- Interface sketches

### Restrictions
- **Explicit prohibition on efficiency claims**
- No deployment assumptions
- No cost normalization against copper systems

**Price Anchor:**  
- $5k – $40k per integration study cycle

**R&D Value:**  
Thought experiments are not press releases.

---

## Phase 8 — Failure Logs, Limits & Closure  
*(Reality documented)*

### Documentation
- Failure conditions
- Operating envelopes
- Environmental and operational costs

### Doctrine
- **Environmental and operational cost summarized in plain language**
- Limits stated without apology
- Silence framed as expensive, not free

**Price Anchor:**  
- $3k – $25k per archival and closure system

**R&D Value:**  
Limits prevent mythology.

## Phase X — Reference Only  
### Instant NTIPS Superconductivity Capability @ Current Market Prices (Non-Binding)

> This phase represents a hypothetical, immediate deployment of full
> superconductivity research, cryogenics, protection, and documentation
> capability using current market pricing.
> It is not part of Phases 0–8 and does not represent planned expenditure.
> Included to anchor realism and support future ARGENT-based reinvestment modeling.

### Assumptions
- Mixed LTS and HTS research capability
- Redundant cryogenic safety systems
- Full quench detection and containment
- Immediate readiness prioritized over discovery speed

### Order-of-Magnitude Cost Reference

#### Cryogenics, Materials & Measurement

#### Protection, Handling & Archival Systems

### Reference Total (SP007 Only)
> **~$4.2M – $11.9M USD**

This excludes:
- Grid-scale deployment
- Commercial productization
- Efficiency marketing claims
- Energy-density extrapolation

## Contribution Modes (Explicit)
- Cryogenic and thermal control systems
- Measurement and quench protection hardware
- Materials research and handling expertise
- Documentation and archival tooling
- Funding earmarked **SP007 only**

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Commercial superconducting products
- Grid-scale conductors
- Black-box materials
- Marketing claims

## Status
**Current:** Superconductivity research doctrine defined and cost-anchored  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Limits respected  
✔ Failure bounded  
✔ Silence earned

### Why SP007 Matters
Silence is expensive.

SP007 teaches us exactly how expensive.
