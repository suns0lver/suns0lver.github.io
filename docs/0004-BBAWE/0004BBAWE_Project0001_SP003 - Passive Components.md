## SP003 — Passive Components

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
Passives are not “support parts.”  
They are where circuits **remember the past**.

This SP is fields and time, not motion.
Unlabeled passives are ticking mysteries.

---

## Phase 0 — Passive Doctrine & Field Thinking  
*(Before winding anything)*

### Core Principles
- Electric and magnetic fields store history
- Time-domain and frequency-domain behavior are **separate design constraints**
- Thermal effects are memory, not noise

**R&D Value:**  
A component that remembers must be treated as a witness, not a part.

---

## Phase 1 — Capacitors (Electric Field Memory)  
*(Charge remembers)*

### Scope
- Ceramic, film, electrolytic, supercapacitor classes
- Dielectric selection tied to voltage, temperature, and time

### Documentation
- Capacitance vs voltage
- Capacitance vs temperature
- **DC bias effects on ceramic capacitance explicitly logged**

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1k – $25k per capacitor research and test set

**R&D Value:**  
Capacitance that changes silently lies to control systems.

---

## Phase 2 — Inductors & Coils (Magnetic Memory)  
*(Fields resist change)*

### Scope
- Air core
- Ferrite core
- Laminated steel
- Experimental geometries

### Documentation
- Inductance vs current
- Saturation behavior
- **Core permeability drift tracked over temperature and time**

**Price Anchor:**  
- $2k – $40k per magnetic component lab

**R&D Value:**  
Magnetics age quietly and fail politely — until they don’t.

---

## Phase 3 — Resistors & Shunts (Truth Enforcers)  
*(Ohm’s law never blinks)*

### Scope
- Precision resistors
- Power resistors
- Shunts for current measurement

### Verification
- Resistance tolerance
- Temperature coefficient
- **Power derating curves logged alongside nominal resistance**

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1k – $20k per resistor and shunt characterization setup

**R&D Value:**  
Truth shifts under heat.

---

## Phase 4 — Dielectrics & Core Materials Research  
*(Material before geometry)*

### Research Axes
- Dielectric constant
- Loss tangent
- Aging behavior

### Doctrine
- **Loss tangent tracked across frequency bands**, not single points
- Material behavior documented at operating extremes

**Price Anchor:**  
- $2k – $30k per materials research tier

**R&D Value:**  
Materials lie at the edges, not the center.

---

## Phase 5 — Assembly, Encapsulation & Protection  
*(Protection without suffocation)*

### Techniques
- Potting
- Encapsulation
- Mechanical isolation

### Documentation
- **Encapsulation effects on thermal dissipation documented**
- Protection methods evaluated as stress multipliers

**Price Anchor:**  
- $1k – $15k per assembly and protection setup

**R&D Value:**  
Protection that traps heat accelerates failure.

---

## Phase 6 — Measurement, Characterization & Aging  
*(Patience enforced)*

### Measurement
- Impedance spectroscopy
- Thermal cycling
- Long-duration soak tests

### Doctrine
- **Measurement uncertainty logged alongside readings**
- Drift treated as data, not error

**Price Anchor:**  
- $3k – $50k per measurement and aging system

**R&D Value:**  
Numbers without uncertainty are fiction.

---

## Phase 7 — Resonance, Filtering & Network Design  
*(Behavior emerges)*

### Scope
- LC networks
- RC filters
- RLC resonance structures

### Metrics
- **Network Q-factor tracked as a first-class metric**
- Phase response documented alongside amplitude

**Price Anchor:**  
- $2k – $35k per network design and test environment

**R&D Value:**  
Q is how a system feels when disturbed.

---

## Phase 8 — Documentation, Labeling & Provenance  
*(Memory preserved)*

### Systems
- Physical labeling
- Digital records
- Batch and lifecycle tracking

### Lifecycle
- **Retirement criteria defined per passive class**
- End-of-life logged explicitly

**Price Anchor:**  
- $500 – $12k per provenance system

**R&D Value:**  
Memory includes knowing when trust expires.

## Phase X — Reference Only  
### Instant NTIPS Passive Capability @ Current Market Prices (Non-Binding)

> This phase represents a hypothetical, immediate deployment of full
> passive component fabrication, characterization, and documentation
> capability using current market pricing.
> It is not part of Phases 0–8 and does not represent planned expenditure.
> Included to anchor realism and support future ARGENT-based reinvestment modeling.

### Assumptions
- Precision component characterization
- In-house winding and fabrication
- Long-duration aging tests
- Immediate readiness over incremental learning

## Contribution Modes (Explicit)
- Passive component fabrication tooling
- Measurement and aging equipment
- Materials research
- Documentation and provenance systems
- Funding earmarked **SP003 only**

### Why SP003 Matters
Circuits don’t forget.

SP003 makes sure we don’t either.
