## SP009 — Safety, Failure & Abuse Testing

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP009 exists to **break systems on purpose, safely, and visibly**.

If SP008 tells the truth gently, SP009 asks it under interrogation.
Failure must end cleanly.
This SP is learning under pressure, not compliance theater.
Only honest systems survive disrespect.

---

## Phase 0 — Failure Doctrine & Ethical Limits  
*(Before anything smokes)*

### Core Principles
- Failure is a tool, not entertainment
- Destruction must be intentional, justified, and bounded
- Silence after failure is mandatory

### Doctrine
- **Non-destructive tests must explicitly document why destruction was avoided**
- **Destructive limits must be stated even when not reached**
- Any avoided failure mode is logged as a decision, not an omission

**R&D Value:**  
Restraint without intent is ignorance.

---

## Phase 1 — Overcurrent & Short-Circuit Testing  
*(Current before heat)*

### Scope
- Hard shorts
- Overcurrent ramps
- Fault insertion

### Documentation
- Failure thresholds
- **Peak let-through energy (I²t) logged alongside outcomes**
- Protection response timing recorded

**Price Anchor:**  
- $10k – $160k per overcurrent testing platform

**R&D Value:**  
Magnitude teaches faster than duration.

---

## Phase 2 — Thermal Stress & Runaway Analysis  
*(Heat before arcs)*

### Scope
- Sustained overload
- Thermal gradients
- Runaway initiation

### Doctrine
- **Thermal runaway propagation paths explicitly mapped**
- Cooling failure treated as a primary test vector
- Residual heat logged post-event

**Price Anchor:**  
- $15k – $220k per thermal abuse testing setup

**R&D Value:**  
Heat spreads socially.

---

## Phase 3 — Arc Fault & Dielectric Breakdown  
*(Arcs before motion)*

### Scope
- Insulation failure
- High-voltage stress
- Arc containment

### Documentation
- Arc initiation conditions
- **Post-arc residue and material degradation logged**
- Dielectric recovery (or lack thereof) recorded

**Price Anchor:**  
- $20k – $300k per arc fault testing system

**R&D Value:**  
Arcs leave evidence even when extinguished.

---

## Phase 4 — Mechanical Shock, Vibration & Fatigue  
*(Motion before environment)*

### Scope
- Impact testing
- Vibration profiles
- Fatigue cycling

### Documentation
- Structural response
- **Fastener loosening and micro-fracture inspection post-test**
- Progressive damage noted across cycles

**Price Anchor:**  
- $12k – $200k per mechanical stress testing platform

**R&D Value:**  
Failure whispers before it screams.

---

## Phase 5 — Environmental Exposure & Corrosion  
*(Environment before humans)*

### Scope
- Moisture
- Dust
- Corrosive atmospheres
- Thermal cycling

### Doctrine
- **Combined-stress scenarios explicitly flagged as higher-order tests**
- Environmental stacking treated as multiplicative, not additive

**Price Anchor:**  
- $10k – $180k per environmental exposure system

**R&D Value:**  
Nature stacks insults.

---

## Phase 6 — Human Error Injection  
*(Humans before recovery)*

### Scope
- Misconfiguration
- Incorrect assembly
- Ambiguous interfaces

### Doctrine
- **Ambiguity tests must document why a human chose incorrectly**
- Blame is prohibited; interpretation is required
- Interface failures treated as design failures

**Price Anchor:**  
- $8k – $140k per human-error testing program

**R&D Value:**  
Blame teaches nothing.

---

## Phase 7 — Containment, Recovery & Post-Failure State  
*(Recovery before memory)*

### Scope
- Containment integrity
- Recovery procedures
- Residual hazard assessment

### Documentation
- **Recovery time logged separately from residual hazard state**
- Silent failure verified before human access
- No reuse without clearance

**Price Anchor:**  
- $12k – $200k per containment and recovery system

**R&D Value:**  
Recovery ≠ safe.

---

## Phase 8 — Failure Archive & Feedback Loop  
*(Memory preserved)*

### Outputs
- Failure reports
- Root-cause analysis
- Cross-domain tags

### Doctrine
- **Cross-domain failure patterns explicitly tagged for reuse**
- Failures become inputs, not footnotes
- Memory must travel

**Price Anchor:**  
- $5k – $80k per archival and feedback system

**R&D Value:**  
Failure only matters if remembered.

---

## Phase X — Reference Only  
### Instant NTIPS Failure & Abuse Testing Capability @ Current Market Prices (Non-Binding)

> This phase represents a hypothetical, immediate deployment of comprehensive
> failure, abuse, containment, and recovery testing capability using current
> market pricing.
> It is not part of Phases 0–8 and does not represent planned expenditure.
> Included to anchor realism and support future ARGENT-based reinvestment modeling.

### Assumptions
- Dedicated failure labs
- Remote monitoring and control
- Containment-first facility design
- Immediate readiness prioritized over incremental testing

---

### Order-of-Magnitude Cost Reference

#### Failure & Abuse Test Infrastructure
➡️ **$1.6M – $4.2M**

#### Containment, Recovery & Archival Systems
➡️ **$700k – $1.9M**

---

### Reference Total (SP009 Only)
> **~$2.3M – $6.1M USD**

This excludes:
- Routine QA testing
- Regulatory compliance labs
- Marketing demonstrations
- Grid-scale fault simulation

---

## Contribution Modes (Explicit)
- Failure and abuse testing hardware
- Containment and safety systems
- Instrumentation and logging platforms
- Archival and analysis tooling
- Funding earmarked **SP009 only**

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Routine quality assurance
- Certification testing
- Public demonstrations
- Spectacle-driven destruction

---

## Status
**Current:** Failure doctrine defined and cost-anchored  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Destruction intentional  
✔ Limits known  
✔ Memory preserved

### Why SP009 Matters
Only honest systems survive disrespect.

SP009 teaches us how to be honest under pressure.
