# SPANCL · Project0001  
## Planar & Nano-Construction Labs — Decomposition

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SPANCL exists to **place atoms on purpose**.

This is not a factory.
This is not a race.
This is a laboratory for truth, geometry, and restraint.

Precision is not scale.
Throughput is not understanding.
Atoms demand respect.

## SP001 — Philosophy, Cleanroom Doctrine & Flow  
*(Precision begins before tools)*

### Scope
- Laboratory philosophy
- Cleanroom behavioral doctrine
- Human and material flow

### Clarified Doctrine
- **Precision explicitly distinguished from scale**
- Cleanliness treated as epistemic hygiene, not compliance
- Flow designed to reduce contamination, interruption, and assumption

**R&D Value:**  
If the room lies, every measurement lies.

---

## SP002 — Environmental Control & Cleanroom Infrastructure  
*(Air, motion, and silence)*

### Scope
- Air handling and filtration
- Temperature and humidity control
- Pressure zoning
- Vibration isolation

### Clarified Doctrine
- **Vibration isolation treated as both mechanical and acoustic**
- Environmental stability logged as data, not background
- Infrastructure designed for repeatability, not comfort

**R&D Value:**  
Nano work hears footsteps.

---

## SP003 — Substrate Preparation & Surface Conditioning  
*(You can’t build on lies)*

### Scope
- Cleaning
- Polishing
- Surface activation
- Conditioning protocols

### Clarified Doctrine
- **Surface history documented as part of substrate identity**
- Preparation steps treated as irreversible transformations
- No “baseline” assumed without proof

**R&D Value:**  
Surfaces remember everything.

---

## SP004 — Deposition & Thin-Film Formation  
*(Laying atoms on purpose)*

### Scope
- Physical vapor deposition
- Chemical vapor deposition
- Atomic layer deposition (bounded)

### Clarified Doctrine
- **Uniformity evaluated statistically, not visually**
- Deposition systems characterized across time, not snapshots
- Films treated as probabilistic structures

**R&D Value:**  
Thin films lie politely.

---

## SP005 — Lithography, Patterning & Resolution  
*(Geometry meets reality)*

### Scope
- Mask-based patterning
- Direct-write techniques
- Alignment and overlay

### Clarified Doctrine
- **Feature size limits treated as physical truth, not engineering challenge**
- Resolution claims require verification, not optimism
- Patterning failures logged as geometric lessons

**R&D Value:**  
Reality sets the limit, not ambition.

---

## SP006 — Etching, Removal & Selectivity  
*(Subtraction is creation)*

### Scope
- Wet etching
- Dry etching
- Selective removal

### Clarified Doctrine
- **Etch damage tracked beneath the surface, not just at it**
- Selectivity treated as a trade, not a guarantee
- Removal processes logged as irreversible events

**R&D Value:**  
Subsurface trauma matters.

---

## SP007 — Metrology, Imaging & Verification  
*(Seeing the invisible)*

### Scope
- Optical metrology
- Electron microscopy
- Surface and layer characterization

### Clarified Doctrine
- **Metrology treated as destructive by default unless proven otherwise**
- Imaging artifacts documented explicitly
- Seeing is never assumed to be free

**R&D Value:**  
Measurement costs something.

---

## SP008 — Chemical Handling, Safety & Waste  
*(Chemistry remembers mistakes)*

### Scope
- Chemical storage and handling
- Safety systems
- Waste processing

### Clarified Doctrine
- **Waste streams treated as forensic evidence**
- Disposal logs treated as research artifacts
- Safety incidents logged as system failures, not operator errors

**R&D Value:**  
Waste tells stories.

---

## SP009 — Failure Modes, Yield & Contamination Analysis  
*(Why it broke matters more than that it broke)*

### Scope
- Yield tracking
- Failure analysis
- Contamination tracing

### Clarified Doctrine
- **Yield treated as a diagnostic signal, not a performance metric**
- Failure patterns tracked across SP boundaries
- Contamination treated as narrative, not noise

**R&D Value:**  
Yield lies without context.

---

## SP010 — Integration, Handoff & Cross-Domain Interfaces  
*(Precision in service of the whole)*

### Scope
- Interfaces with MAM, MIFF, BBAWE, LOAMS, EBOPFS
- Material and knowledge handoff
- Documentation standards

### Clarified Doctrine
- **SPANCL optimizes for truth transfer, not throughput**
- Cross-domain handoff requires verification and provenance
- Precision preserved beyond the lab boundary

**R&D Value:**  
Truth must survive transit.

---

## Status
**Current:** Decomposition complete, doctrine clarified  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Environment honest  
✔ Geometry respected  
✔ Truth transferable

### Why SPANCL Matters
Power teaches restraint.  
SPANCL teaches atoms obedience.

Without SPANCL, scale lies.
