## SP003 — Substrate Preparation & Surface Conditioning

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP003 exists to **ensure that nothing is built on a lie**.

Surface roughness is geometry.  
Contamination is chemistry.  
Stress is future failure.

Preparation steps are **irreversible transformations**, not tuning operations.

---

## Core Principles
- Surfaces are systems, not starting points
- Substrate identity includes its history
- Damage that cannot be seen still dominates yield

**R&D Value:**  
You cannot compensate for a bad substrate.

---

## Phase 0 — Substrate Doctrine & Taxonomy  
*(Identity before action)*

### Scope
- Substrate classes
- Provenance tracking
- Lot segregation

### Doctrine
- **Substrates with unknown prior history are explicitly prohibited**
- Each substrate carries a documented lineage
- Identity is lost if provenance is broken

**R&D Value:**  
Unknown pasts poison statistics.

---

## Phase 1 — Mechanical Preparation & Planarization  
*(Mechanics before chemistry)*

### Scope
- Lapping
- Polishing
- Planarization

### Doctrine
- **Flatness specifications tied to downstream process wavelength or feature scale**
- Mechanical removal treated as stress injection
- Surface topology logged before and after processing

**R&D Value:**  
Flat enough depends on what comes next.

---

## Phase 2 — Cleaning & Decontamination  
*(Chemistry before activation)*

### Scope
- Solvent cleaning
- Wet chemical processes
- Plasma cleaning (bounded)

### Doctrine
- **Re-deposition treated as a failure mode, not a cleaning artifact**
- Cleanliness verified, not assumed
- Residuals tracked chemically, not visually

**R&D Value:**  
Cleanliness can undo itself.

---

## Phase 3 — Surface Activation & Energy Control  
*(Activation before protection)*

### Scope
- Plasma activation
- Chemical activation
- UV/ozone treatment

### Doctrine
- **Activation lifetime explicitly documented**
- Surface energy decay treated as a time-dependent variable
- No activation assumed permanent

**R&D Value:**  
Activated surfaces forget quickly.

---

## Phase 4 — Oxide, Passivation & Barrier Formation  
*(Protection before damage)*

### Scope
- Native oxide management
- Controlled passivation
- Barrier layers

### Doctrine
- **Native oxide variability tracked per substrate lot**
- Oxide thickness treated as stochastic, not nominal
- Passivation logged as chemical state change

**R&D Value:**  
Oxides are not uniform.

---

## Phase 5 — Stress, Defect & Damage Control  
*(Damage before handling)*

### Scope
- Subsurface damage
- Defect generation
- Stress accumulation

### Doctrine
- **Subsurface damage depth treated as a first-class metric**
- Stress profiles logged alongside surface metrics
- Invisible damage treated as yield-critical

**R&D Value:**  
What you cannot see will decide failure.

---

## Phase 6 — Handling, Transport & Storage Discipline  
*(Handling before verification)*

### Scope
- Transport protocols
- Temporary storage
- Exposure control

### Doctrine
- **Maximum exposure time outside controlled environments defined per substrate class**
- Handling events logged as state changes
- Time treated as a contaminant

**R&D Value:**  
Time degrades truth.

---

## Phase 7 — Verification, Metrology & Surface Truth  
*(Verification before memory)*

### Scope
- Roughness measurement
- Thickness verification
- Defect inspection

### Doctrine
- **Verification methods explicitly bounded by resolution limits**
- Measurement uncertainty logged with results
- Silence treated as data

**R&D Value:**  
Seeing has limits.

---

## Phase 8 — Failure Modes & Prep Lineage  
*(Memory preserved)*

### Scope
- Failure analysis
- Scrap vs rework thresholds
- Lineage feedback

### Doctrine
- **Prep restart thresholds explicitly documented**
- Rework treated as new lineage
- Hope is not a process

**R&D Value:**  
Memory prevents repetition.

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Deposition processes
- Lithography and patterning
- Etching and removal
- Full imaging and metrology tooling

---

## Status
**Current:** Substrate truth enforced, lineage locked  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Identity known  
✔ Damage bounded  
✔ Surfaces honest  

---

### Why SP003 Matters
Precision does not begin with tools.

It begins with truth.
