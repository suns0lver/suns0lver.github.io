# SPANCL · Project0001  
## SP010 — Integration, Handoff & Cross-Domain Interfaces

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SPANCL does not scale outward.  
**The world scales inward to meet it.**

SP010 exists to integrate precision **without dilution**.

**Integration is treated as a controlled loss event, not a neutral transfer.**

This SP governs how truth survives contact with the outside world.

---

## Core Principles
- Integration degrades precision unless actively resisted
- Boundaries are protective instruments
- Sovereignty precedes compatibility

**R&D Value:**  
Continuity is harder than invention.

---

## Phase 0 — Interface Ontology & Boundary Definition  
*(Ontology before movement)*

### Scope
- Interface classification
- Boundary definition
- Exit conditions

### Doctrine
- **Any ambiguity defaults to “cannot exit SPANCL”**
- Boundaries defined explicitly, not implicitly
- Interfaces treated as risk surfaces

**R&D Value:**  
Ambiguity is contamination.

---

## Phase 1 — Physical Artifact Handoff Systems  
*(Movement before buffering)*

### Scope
- Physical transfer mechanisms
- Transport protocols
- Handling controls

### Doctrine
- **Transport vibration and shock treated as latent defect sources**
- Handoff success verified post-transfer
- Movement logged as integrity event

**R&D Value:**  
Movement damages silently.

---

## Phase 2 — Environmental Decoupling & Buffer Zones  
*(Buffering before metadata)*

### Scope
- Transitional environments
- Clean-to-dirty gradients
- Isolation layers

### Doctrine
- **Buffer zones audited for drift over time**
- Environmental gradients treated as living systems
- No permanent buffers without review

**R&D Value:**  
Buffers decay.

---

## Phase 3 — Process Metadata & Provenance Attachment  
*(Metadata before contracts)*

### Scope
- Provenance records
- Process lineage
- Context preservation

### Doctrine
- **Metadata loss treated as integrity failure equivalent to physical damage**
- Provenance must travel with artifacts
- Context never assumed recoverable later

**R&D Value:**  
Truth must survive transit.

---

## Phase 4 — Interface Standards by Domain  
*(Contracts before scale)*

### Scope
- Domain-specific interface rules
- Translation boundaries
- Contract enforcement

### Doctrine
- **Interface standards versioned and sunset explicitly**
- Backward compatibility never assumed
- Translation loss documented explicitly

**R&D Value:**  
Old rules rot.

---

## Phase 5 — Scaling Discipline & “No-Scale” Rules  
*(Scale before feedback)*

### Scope
- Scale gating
- Replication controls
- Growth vetoes

### Doctrine
- **Lab veto authority explicitly documented as non-overridable**
- Scaling treated as experimental condition
- Success does not grant permission

**R&D Value:**  
Success destroys labs faster than failure.

---

## Phase 6 — Feedback Loops Back Into SPANCL  
*(Feedback before security)*

### Scope
- Downstream feedback ingestion
- Degradation reporting
- Learning loops

### Doctrine
- **Feedback latency treated as a degradation metric**
- Delayed feedback flagged explicitly
- External observations never override internal truth

**R&D Value:**  
Late truth is diluted truth.

---

## Phase 7 — Security, Access & Sovereignty Controls  
*(Security before ritual)*

### Scope
- Access permissions
- Tamper detection
- Sovereignty enforcement

### Doctrine
- **Tamper detection events logged as epistemic failures**
- Access decay reviewed periodically
- Security failures treated as knowledge failures

**R&D Value:**  
Trust erosion matters.

---

## Phase 8 — Documentation, Ritual & Stewardship  
*(Memory preserved)*

### Scope
- Integration rituals
- Stewardship practices
- Long-term guardianship

### Doctrine
- **Precision debt treated as an accumulating liability requiring repayment**
- Rituals enforced to prevent drift
- Stewardship survives personnel turnover

**R&D Value:**  
Precision decays unless guarded.

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Fabrication activities
- Tooling and process invention
- Production optimization
- Commercial scaling

---

## Status
**Current:** Integration doctrine locked  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Boundaries enforced  
✔ Loss acknowledged  
✔ Sovereignty preserved

### Why SP010 Matters
Labs create miracles.

Civilizations carry them forward intact.
