# SPANCL · Project0001  
## SP001 — Philosophy, Cleanroom Doctrine & Flow

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP001 exists to **protect intent at the atomic scale**.

Cleanrooms are not rooms.  
They are **behavioral contracts**.

At the atomic scale, intent travels through discipline.

---

## Core Principles — The SPANCL Constitution

- Precision precedes scale  
- Discipline precedes equipment  
- Cleanliness is epistemic, not cosmetic  
- **Convenience is treated as a contamination vector**  
- Human behavior is the dominant variable  

**R&D Value:**  
If discipline fails, no tool can compensate.

---

## Phase 0 — Cleanroom Ontology & Zoning  
*(Ontology before walls)*

### Scope
- Conceptual cleanroom zoning
- Authority boundaries
- Contamination domains

### Doctrine
- **Zone boundaries are authority boundaries, not merely physical ones**
- Quarantine zones explicitly named and enforced
- No cross-zone assumption of cleanliness

**R&D Value:**  
If authority is unclear, contamination decides.

---

## Phase 1 — Human Flow & Behavioral Discipline  
*(Humans before air)*

### Scope
- Personnel movement
- Gowning protocols
- Behavioral sequencing

### Doctrine
- **Fatigue treated as a contamination multiplier**
- Discipline enforced structurally, not socially
- Errors logged as system signals, not personal faults

**R&D Value:**  
Tired humans shed more than skin.

---

## Phase 2 — Airflow, Pressure & Particle Control (Conceptual)  
*(Air before tools)*

### Scope
- Pressure gradients
- Laminar flow intent
- Particle movement logic

### Doctrine
- **Airflow direction treated as one-way information flow**
- Pressure is treated as a control signal
- No airflow assumptions without verification

**R&D Value:**  
Particles travel narratives.

---

## Phase 3 — Material & Tool Flow  
*(Tools before chemistry)*

### Scope
- Tool residency
- Material ingress/egress
- Tool segregation

### Doctrine
- **Tool residency violations logged as contamination events**
- Tools possess memory through exposure
- No shared tools without provenance

**R&D Value:**  
Tools remember where they’ve been.

---

## Phase 4 — Chemical Segregation Doctrine  
*(Chemistry before surfaces)*

### Scope
- Chemical zoning
- Storage doctrine
- Adjacency rules

### Doctrine
- **Chemical adjacency treated as a higher-order risk than chemical identity**
- Compatibility is spatial, not categorical
- Mixing paths explicitly forbidden

**R&D Value:**  
Safe chemicals become dangerous neighbors.

---

## Phase 5 — Surface Contact & Cleanability  
*(Surfaces before stillness)*

### Scope
- Contact surfaces
- Cleanability assessment
- Hidden volume analysis

### Doctrine
- **Hidden volumes treated as latent contamination reservoirs**
- Surfaces judged by their worst-case cleanability
- No inaccessible surfaces accepted

**R&D Value:**  
What you cannot clean will decide your yield.

---

## Phase 6 — Vibration, Noise & Thermal Stillness  
*(Stillness before access)*

### Scope
- Mechanical vibration
- Acoustic noise
- Thermal drift

### Doctrine
- **Stillness requirements explicitly trump convenience and shared infrastructure**
- Environmental disturbance treated as contamination
- Stability logged, not assumed

**R&D Value:**  
Atoms hear everything.

---

## Phase 7 — Access Control & Ritualized Entry  
*(Access before memory)*

### Scope
- Access permissions
- Entry rituals
- Behavioral verification

### Doctrine
- **Ritual failure treated as system failure, not operator failure**
- Access is a privilege bound to state
- Rituals encode intent

**R&D Value:**  
Ritual enforces memory when discipline fades.

---

## Phase 8 — Documentation, Memory & Audit Trails  
*(Memory preserved)*

### Scope
- Logs
- Audit trails
- Behavioral records

### Doctrine
- **Audit trails explicitly linked forward to SP009 failure analysis**
- Memory treated as a first-class system
- Documentation survives personnel turnover

**R&D Value:**  
If it isn’t remembered, it will be repeated.

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Tooling selection
- Deposition methods
- Lithography systems
- Metrology hardware
- Chemical recipes

---

## Status
**Current:** Doctrine locked, behavioral contract defined  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Authority clear  
✔ Discipline enforced  
✔ Intent protected

### Why SP001 Matters
SPANCL does not begin with machines.

It begins with behavior.

Without SP001, precision is accidental.
