## SP007 — Metrology, Imaging & Verification

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP007 exists to answer one question honestly:

**What did we actually build?**

Unseen defects dominate behavior.  
Averages lie.  
Verification is survival.

**Images without uncertainty bounds are treated as stories, not data.**

---

## Core Principles
- Seeing is an intervention, not a neutral act
- Resolution without context misleads
- Measurement uncertainty is part of the result

**R&D Value:**  
If you don’t know what you can’t see, you don’t know what you saw.

---

## Phase 0 — Metrology Doctrine & Measurement Strategy  
*(Doctrine before tools)*

### Scope
- Measurement intent
- Technique selection
- Epistemic boundaries

### Doctrine
- **Every measurement must explicitly state what it cannot see**
- Measurement strategy defined before tool choice
- No result accepted without stated limitations

**R&D Value:**  
Humility prevents false confidence.

---

## Phase 1 — Optical & Surface Inspection  
*(Visibility before resolution)*

### Scope
- Optical microscopy
- Surface inspection
- Gross defect detection

### Doctrine
- **Illumination conditions logged as part of measurement state**
- Contrast enhancement treated as interpretation
- Optical inspection used for navigation, not proof

**R&D Value:**  
Lighting lies.

---

## Phase 2 — Profilometry & Thickness Measurement  
*(Geometry before texture)*

### Scope
- Stylus profilometry
- Optical profilometry
- Step-height measurement

### Doctrine
- **Stylus-induced damage risk explicitly evaluated and logged**
- Measurement force treated as process variable
- Thickness data tied to downstream tolerance needs

**R&D Value:**  
Touch costs something.

---

## Phase 3 — Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM)  
*(Texture before electrons)*

### Scope
- AFM
- Related probe techniques

### Doctrine
- **Tip condition treated as part of the instrument**
- Tip wear logged as data degradation
- Scan artifacts documented explicitly

**R&D Value:**  
A dull tip lies convincingly.

---

## Phase 4 — Electron-Based Imaging (Survey-Scale)  
*(Electrons before alignment)*

### Scope
- SEM (bounded)
- Low-dose imaging
- Survey inspection

### Doctrine
- **Electron dose budgets explicitly defined per material stack**
- Beam damage treated as cumulative
- Imaging order planned to minimize harm

**R&D Value:**  
Electrons destroy quietly.

---

## Phase 5 — Alignment, Overlay & Registration Verification  
*(Alignment before chemistry)*

### Scope
- Overlay metrology
- Registration verification
- Layer-to-layer alignment

### Doctrine
- **Overlay errors treated as multiplicative across layers**
- Alignment uncertainty propagated forward
- Single-layer success not considered validation

**R&D Value:**  
Small errors stack brutally.

---

## Phase 6 — Composition & Material Verification  
*(Chemistry before statistics)*

### Scope
- Elemental analysis
- Composition verification
- Material confirmation

### Doctrine
- **Elemental presence distinguished from functional participation**
- Trace elements logged even if non-functional
- Composition uncertainty recorded explicitly

**R&D Value:**  
Wrong atoms sometimes hide.

---

## Phase 7 — Statistical Process Verification  
*(Statistics before memory)*

### Scope
- Sample selection
- Distribution analysis
- Outlier identification

### Doctrine
- **Outliers treated as signals first, noise second**
- Statistical summaries accompanied by raw distributions
- Confidence intervals required for acceptance

**R&D Value:**  
Outliers teach.

---

## Phase 8 — Imaging Archives & Measurement Memory  
*(Memory preserved)*

### Scope
- Image storage
- Metadata preservation
- Cross-SP linkage

### Doctrine
- **Image provenance explicitly linked forward to SP009 failure analysis**
- Measurement memory treated as first-class system
- Data survives tool and personnel turnover

**R&D Value:**  
Truth must travel.

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Pattern generation
- Etching and removal chemistry
- Chemical waste handling
- Deposition process control

---

## Status
**Current:** Verification doctrine locked, uncertainty enforced  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Limits declared  
✔ Damage bounded  
✔ Memory preserved  

---

### Why SP007 Matters
Fabrication creates possibility.

Verification decides reality.
