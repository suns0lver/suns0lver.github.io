## SP006 — Etching, Removal & Selectivity

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP006 exists to **remove matter without erasing meaning**.

Selectivity is survival.  
Anisotropy is geometry.  
Residues are future failures.

Removal is an **irreversible commitment**, not corrective tuning.

If SP005 drew the map, SP006 cuts the terrain.

---

## Core Principles
- Subtraction defines final truth
- Selectivity outranks speed
- Every etch leaves memory

**R&D Value:**  
Anyone can remove material. Only discipline removes exactly enough.

---

## Phase 0 — Etch Ontology & Selectivity Doctrine  
*(Ontology before chemistry)*

### Scope
- Etch intent definition
- Selectivity targets
- Stack-aware strategy

### Doctrine
- **Etch strategy must explicitly reference SP003 substrate history and SP004 stack intent**
- Selectivity defined relative to critical layers, not averages
- Timing never substitutes for compatibility

**R&D Value:**  
If you don’t know what you’re protecting, you will remove it.

---

## Phase 1 — Wet Etching Systems  
*(Chemistry before plasma)*

### Scope
- Acidic and basic wet etches
- Isotropic removal
- Bath management

### Doctrine
- **Bath aging treated as chemical drift**
- Etch rate verified periodically
- Solution history logged as process input

**R&D Value:**  
Chemistry remembers.

---

## Phase 2 — Dry Etching (Plasma-Based)  
*(Plasma before selectivity)*

### Scope
- RIE
- ICP (bounded)
- Reactive chemistries

### Doctrine
- **Ion energy distributions logged, not just nominal RF power**
- Plasma state treated as material interaction
- Power transients logged as etch events

**R&D Value:**  
Power settings lie.

---

## Phase 3 — Selectivity Engineering  
*(Selectivity before masking)*

### Scope
- Stop layers
- Chemistry selection
- Layer discrimination

### Doctrine
- **Stop-layer failure treated as material incompatibility before timing error**
- Selectivity verified empirically
- Etch recipes tied to stack identity

**R&D Value:**  
Compatibility decides survival.

---

## Phase 4 — Mask Integrity & Erosion Control  
*(Masking before profile)*

### Scope
- Mask materials
- Erosion monitoring
- Feature protection

### Doctrine
- **Mask erosion tracked relative to feature criticality**
- Loss tolerated only where non-critical
- Mask failure logged as geometry loss

**R&D Value:**  
Some loss matters more.

---

## Phase 5 — Profile Control & Microloading Effects  
*(Profile before cleanup)*

### Scope
- Aspect ratio dependent etching (ARDE)
- Loading effects
- Feature density impacts

### Doctrine
- **Microloading effects mapped across pattern density regions**
- Profile variation treated as systemic behavior
- Uniformity evaluated spatially

**R&D Value:**  
Density lies.

---

## Phase 6 — Residue, Damage & Surface Recovery  
*(Cleanup before stopping)*

### Scope
- Residue removal
- Damage mitigation
- Surface recovery

### Doctrine
- **Residue removal verified chemically, not visually**
- Subsurface damage tracked post-etch
- Recovery steps logged as new lineage

**R&D Value:**  
Clean cuts still lie.

---

## Phase 7 — Endpoint Detection & Process Control  
*(Stopping before memory)*

### Scope
- Optical endpoint detection
- Time-based stopping (bounded)
- Feedback control

### Doctrine
- **Endpoint uncertainty recorded alongside stop decision**
- Stop events treated as probabilistic
- Manual overrides logged explicitly

**R&D Value:**  
Stopping is never exact.

---

## Phase 8 — Failure Modes, Yield & Etch Lineage  
*(Memory preserved)*

### Scope
- Etch-related failures
- Yield impact analysis
- Lineage tracking

### Doctrine
- **Rework feasibility bounded by cumulative damage depth**
- Rework treated as new etch lineage
- Scrap decisions documented with rationale

**R&D Value:**  
Undo has limits.

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Pattern generation
- Deposition processes
- Full metrology and imaging hardware
- Chemical waste handling systems

---

## Status
**Current:** Selective subtraction doctrine locked  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Protection defined  
✔ Removal bounded  
✔ Memory preserved

### Why SP006 Matters
Subtraction defines what remains.

SP006 ensures what remains is intentional.
