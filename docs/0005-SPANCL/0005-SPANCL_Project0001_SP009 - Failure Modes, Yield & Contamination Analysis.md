## SP009 — Failure Modes, Yield & Contamination Analysis

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP009 exists to **explain why reality deviated from intent**.

Defects compound nonlinearly.  
Small contaminants dominate outcomes.  
Yield is an emergent property.

**Correlation is treated as a hypothesis generator, never as proof.**

If SP007 showed what happened, SP009 explains why—and how to prevent recurrence.

---

## Core Principles
- Causality outranks correlation
- Yield without context lies
- Learning must survive personnel and tools

**R&D Value:**  
Understanding prevents repetition.

---

## Phase 0 — Failure Taxonomy & Yield Language  
*(Language before counting)*

### Scope
- Failure classification
- Yield definitions
- Layer- and step-specific metrics

### Doctrine
- **Yield metrics must always reference process step and layer**
- Global yield used only as summary, never diagnosis
- Language standardized before analysis

**R&D Value:**  
If you name failures poorly, you cannot fix them.

---

## Phase 1 — Defect Detection Aggregation  
*(Aggregation before correlation)*

### Scope
- Defect map aggregation
- Cross-tool data ingestion
- Spatial analysis

### Doctrine
- **Spatial defect maps normalized against expected random distributions**
- Clustering must exceed chance to matter
- Absence of defects treated as data

**R&D Value:**  
Clusters must beat chance.

---

## Phase 2 — Process Lineage & Step Correlation  
*(Correlation before attribution)*

### Scope
- Process genealogy
- Step-by-step correlation
- Environmental overlays

### Doctrine
- **Operator and environment correlations treated as confounders until isolated**
- Lineage breaks flagged as analysis blockers
- Correlation never implies blame

**R&D Value:**  
Humans are variables, not explanations.

---

## Phase 3 — Contamination Source Attribution  
*(Attribution before statistics)*

### Scope
- Chemical forensics
- Tool memory analysis
- Environmental tracing

### Doctrine
- **Tool memory audits mandatory after any unexplained yield shift**
- Contamination hypotheses ranked by plausibility
- Attribution requires multiple independent confirmations

**R&D Value:**  
Tools remember mistakes.

---

## Phase 4 — Statistical Yield Modeling  
*(Statistics before intervention)*

### Scope
- SPC
- Control charting
- Distribution modeling

### Doctrine
- **Control limits treated as living boundaries**
- Model assumptions documented explicitly
- Statistical comfort never replaces investigation

**R&D Value:**  
Processes drift.

---

## Phase 5 — Design of Experiments (DoE)  
*(Intervention before replication)*

### Scope
- Factor isolation
- Interaction testing
- Hypothesis validation

### Doctrine
- **DoE plans must document which interactions are assumed negligible**
- Experiments bounded to protect yield
- Learning prioritized over speed

**R&D Value:**  
Assumptions matter.

---

## Phase 6 — Failure Replication & Stress Testing  
*(Replication before correction)*

### Scope
- Controlled failure recreation
- Stress amplification
- Boundary probing

### Doctrine
- **Failure replication success criteria defined before testing**
- Partial replication documented honestly
- Replication failures treated as data

**R&D Value:**  
Moving goalposts erases truth.

---

## Phase 7 — Corrective Action & Process Hardening  
*(Correction before memory)*

### Scope
- Process adjustments
- Control updates
- Hardening strategies

### Doctrine
- **Corrective actions include rollback criteria if yield degrades elsewhere**
- Fixes validated across adjacent processes
- No correction accepted without verification

**R&D Value:**  
Fixes can break neighbors.

---

## Phase 8 — Yield Memory, Lessons & Closure  
*(Memory preserved)*

### Scope
- Lessons learned
- Preventive rules
- Knowledge transfer

### Doctrine
- **“Never again” rules require explicit enforcement mechanisms**
- Memory systems audited periodically
- Closure requires demonstrated prevention

**R&D Value:**  
Memory without enforcement decays.

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Tool acquisition
- New process invention
- Metrology hardware
- Chemical handling systems

---

## Status
**Current:** Causal learning engine locked  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Language precise  
✔ Causes isolated  
✔ Memory enforced

Fabrication creates complexity.

SP009 turns complexity into mastery.
