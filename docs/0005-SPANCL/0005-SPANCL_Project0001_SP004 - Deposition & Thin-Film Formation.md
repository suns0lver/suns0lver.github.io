## SP004 — Deposition & Thin-Film Formation

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP004 exists to **lay atoms deliberately, repeatably, and reversibly**.

Thickness is functionality.  
Uniformity is reliability.  
Interfaces are destiny.

Deposition is a **commitment event**, not a reversible tweak.

---

## Core Principles
- Material stacks are intentional architectures
- Every deposited atom carries memory
- Reversibility has cost and consequence

**R&D Value:**  
Once atoms land, reality begins.

---

## Phase 0 — Deposition Ontology & Material Stack Design  
*(Intent before chambers)*

### Scope
- Allowed material systems
- Stack ordering doctrine
- Compatibility boundaries

### Doctrine
- **Any unlisted material pairing requires Phase 0 re-entry**
- Stack design precedes tool selection
- Interfaces defined before thickness

**R&D Value:**  
If intent is unclear, the stack will decide for you.

---

## Phase 1 — Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD)  
*(Physics before chemistry)*

### Scope
- Sputtering
- Evaporation
- Target management

### Doctrine
- **Deposition rate drift tracked across target lifetime**
- Target aging treated as material variability
- Power transients logged as deposition events

**R&D Value:**  
Targets age. Films remember.

---

## Phase 2 — Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD)  
*(Chemistry before precision)*

### Scope
- Thermal CVD
- Plasma-enhanced CVD
- Precursor management

### Doctrine
- **Precursor decomposition byproducts treated as contamination unless proven otherwise**
- Gas-phase reactions logged as material inputs
- Chamber history treated as chemical state

**R&D Value:**  
CVD lies politely.

---

## Phase 3 — Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD)  
*(Precision before integrity)*

### Scope
- Self-limiting reactions
- Cycle-based growth
- Interface control

### Doctrine
- **ALD cycle count treated as material identity**
- Growth-per-cycle verified periodically
- Saturation failures treated as chemistry faults

**R&D Value:**  
Cycles matter more than thickness.

---

## Phase 4 — Thickness, Uniformity & Stress Control  
*(Integrity before interfaces)*

### Scope
- Thickness measurement
- Uniformity mapping
- Stress management

### Doctrine
- **Stress gradients evaluated across the substrate**
- Uniformity treated statistically, not visually
- Stress accumulation logged with time history

**R&D Value:**  
Cracks start at edges.

---

## Phase 5 — Interface Engineering & Adhesion  
*(Interfaces before cleanliness)*

### Scope
- Adhesion layers
- Interface preparation
- Boundary chemistry

### Doctrine
- **Interface failures treated as material incompatibility before process error**
- Adhesion success verified mechanically and chemically
- Interfaces documented as first-class structures

**R&D Value:**  
Interfaces decide longevity.

---

## Phase 6 — Contamination Control During Deposition  
*(Cleanliness before belief)*

### Scope
- Chamber cleanliness
- Tool seasoning
- Cross-material isolation

### Doctrine
- **Chamber seasoning states logged as part of material lineage**
- Tool reuse bounded by contamination risk
- Cleanliness verified, not assumed

**R&D Value:**  
Seasoning is memory.

---

## Phase 7 — Film Characterization & Verification (Inline)  
*(Belief before undo)*

### Scope
- Thickness verification
- Uniformity checks
- Stress indicators

### Doctrine
- **Verification uncertainty recorded alongside results**
- Inline checks bounded by resolution limits
- Absence of signal treated as data

**R&D Value:**  
Measurement without uncertainty lies.

---

## Phase 8 — Failure Modes, Removal & Rework  
*(Undo has scars)*

### Scope
- Film removal
- Rework thresholds
- Damage assessment

### Doctrine
- **Removal damage depth tracked as part of failure cost**
- Rework treated as new lineage
- Scrap decisions documented explicitly

**R&D Value:**  
Undo is not free.

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Lithography and patterning
- Etching and selective removal
- Full metrology and imaging
- Chemical waste handling

---

## Status
**Current:** Deposition doctrine locked, commitment enforced  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Stack intent defined  
✔ Interfaces respected  
✔ Reversibility bounded

### Why SP004 Matters
This is where SPANCL stops theorizing.

And starts committing atoms to memory.
