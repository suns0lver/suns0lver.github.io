## SP008 — Chemical Handling, Safety & Waste

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP008 exists to **let chemistry work without letting it wander**.

Small spills compound.  
Vapors travel farther than intent.  
Waste remembers processes.  
Safety failures erase trust instantly.

**Chemical safety is irreversible responsibility, not risk management.**

This SP is containment, not creation.

---

## Core Principles
- Chemistry is power that does not forgive
- Containment precedes curiosity
- Waste is memory, not refuse

**R&D Value:**  
Precision without stewardship becomes harm.

---

## Phase 0 — Chemical Ontology & Compatibility Mapping  
*(Ontology before storage)*

### Scope
- Chemical identification
- Compatibility matrices
- Hazard classification

### Doctrine
- **Unknown chemical identity or incomplete SDS triggers quarantine by default**
- Compatibility defined chemically, not administratively
- No assumptions tolerated

**R&D Value:**  
Unknowns are failures.

---

## Phase 1 — Chemical Storage & Inventory Discipline  
*(Storage before movement)*

### Scope
- Storage zoning
- Inventory tracking
- Container integrity

### Doctrine
- **Expiration treated as chemical state change, not administrative date**
- Storage conditions logged continuously
- Inventory drift treated as contamination risk

**R&D Value:**  
Expired chemistry lies.

---

## Phase 2 — Delivery, Dispensing & Transfer  
*(Movement before air)*

### Scope
- Dispensing systems
- Transfer protocols
- Quantity control

### Doctrine
- **Transfer events logged as state transitions, not just quantities**
- Movement minimized by design
- No casual handling permitted

**R&D Value:**  
Movement is risk.

---

## Phase 3 — Fume Hoods, Exhaust & Vapor Control  
*(Air before failure)*

### Scope
- Fume hoods
- Local exhaust
- Vapor capture

### Doctrine
- **Vapor capture efficiency verified under worst-case process conditions**
- Hood performance logged over time
- Airflow treated as containment tool

**R&D Value:**  
Best-case tests lie.

---

## Phase 4 — Spill Containment & Emergency Response  
*(Failure before disposal)*

### Scope
- Spill kits
- Containment systems
- Emergency procedures

### Doctrine
- **Emergency response drills logged as system tests**
- Spill response evaluated structurally, not performatively
- No unverified cleanup accepted

**R&D Value:**  
Practice reveals truth.

---

## Phase 5 — Waste Segregation & Neutralization  
*(Disposal before sensing)*

### Scope
- Waste classification
- Neutralization processes
- Temporary storage

### Doctrine
- **Neutralization reactions verified chemically**
- Waste streams segregated by process origin
- “Neutral” does not imply inert

**R&D Value:**  
Assumptions leak.

---

## Phase 6 — Environmental Monitoring & Exposure Tracking  
*(Sensing before people)*

### Scope
- Gas sensors
- Exposure monitoring
- Environmental logging

### Doctrine
- **Sensor silence treated as a failure mode**
- Detection limits documented
- Absence of alarm never assumed safe

**R&D Value:**  
No signal can mean blind.

---

## Phase 7 — Training, Access Control & Ritualized Handling  
*(People before memory)*

### Scope
- Training protocols
- Access permissions
- Handling rituals

### Doctrine
- **Ritual violations treated as system failures, not individual failures**
- Access bound to demonstrated discipline
- Training logs preserved longitudinally

**R&D Value:**  
Blame teaches nothing.

---

## Phase 8 — Waste Documentation, Compliance & Memory  
*(Memory preserved)*

### Scope
- Waste records
- Compliance documentation
- Cross-SP linkage

### Doctrine
- **Waste records explicitly linked forward to SP009 failure and contamination analysis**
- Documentation survives personnel turnover
- Memory treated as safety system

**R&D Value:**  
Memory prevents repetition.

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Deposition chemistry
- Etching process control
- Metrology hardware
- Fabrication tooling

---

## Status
**Current:** Chemical stewardship doctrine locked  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Containment enforced  
✔ Movement bounded  
✔ Memory preserved

### Why SP008 Matters
Anyone can use chemistry.

Only responsible systems deserve to.
