## SP005 — Lithography, Patterning & Resolution

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
SP005 exists to **impose geometry without betraying physics**.

Resolution defines capability.  
Alignment defines yield.  
Distortion defines failure.

**Patterning is the act of choosing what cannot exist.**

If you can’t align it twice, you didn’t align it once.

---

## Core Principles
- Geometry is constraint, not freedom
- Resolution is statistical, not absolute
- Alignment errors compound silently

**R&D Value:**  
Dreams shrink here so reality can survive.

---

## Phase 0 — Pattern Ontology & Resolution Doctrine  
*(Ontology before chemistry)*

### Scope
- Pattern intent
- Feature density tradeoffs
- Resolution limits

### Doctrine
- **Minimum feature size treated as a statistical limit, not a guarantee**
- Yield prioritized over density
- Pattern success defined probabilistically

**R&D Value:**  
False precision destroys yield.

---

## Phase 1 — Photoresists & Sensitivity Control  
*(Chemistry before optics)*

### Scope
- Resist selection
- Sensitivity tuning
- Aging behavior

### Doctrine
- **Resist aging treated as chemical drift**
- Shelf life logged as process variable
- Sensitivity verified periodically

**R&D Value:**  
Resists decay quietly.

---

## Phase 2 — Optical Lithography Systems  
*(Optics before alignment)*

### Scope
- Projection systems
- Illumination control
- Focus management

### Doctrine
- **Exposure dose windows treated as probabilistic bands**
- Focus drift logged over time
- Optical stability verified before patterning

**R&D Value:**  
Dose is a range, not a number.

---

## Phase 3 — Masking, Alignment & Overlay  
*(Alignment before flexibility)*

### Scope
- Mask alignment
- Overlay control
- Registration systems

### Doctrine
- **Alignment mark damage treated as geometry corruption**
- Overlay errors tracked cumulatively
- Re-alignment success required for validation

**R&D Value:**  
Marks age. Geometry remembers.

---

## Phase 4 — Maskless & Direct-Write Methods (Bounded)  
*(Flexibility with consequence)*

### Scope
- Electron beam
- Laser direct-write
- Focused ion beam (bounded)

### Doctrine
- **Stitching errors logged as geometric debt**
- Direct-write used for learning, not throughput
- Boundaries enforced explicitly

**R&D Value:**  
Debt accumulates.

---

## Phase 5 — Development, Bake & Profile Control  
*(Exposure before development)*

### Scope
- Development chemistry
- Bake sequencing
- Profile formation

### Doctrine
- **Developer exhaustion treated as a silent failure mode**
- Profile evolution logged across time
- Bake drift tracked as geometry change

**R&D Value:**  
Developers lie last.

---

## Phase 6 — Distortion, Drift & Field Effects  
*(Development before environment)*

### Scope
- Field distortion
- Thermal drift
- Environmental coupling

### Doctrine
- **Distortion sources explicitly mapped to SP002 environmental logs**
- Drift treated as system-level behavior
- Geometry evaluated across the full field

**R&D Value:**  
Environment bends geometry.

---

## Phase 7 — Verification, Imaging & Resolution Truth  
*(Environment before seeing)*

### Scope
- Pattern inspection
- Resolution verification
- Overlay validation

### Doctrine
- **Resolution claims invalid unless verified at multiple field locations**
- Imaging uncertainty logged with results
- Single-point verification prohibited

**R&D Value:**  
One field is a lie.

---

## Phase 8 — Failure Modes, Rework & Pattern Memory  
*(Seeing before memory)*

### Scope
- Pattern failure analysis
- Rework thresholds
- Lineage tracking

### Doctrine
- **Rework thresholds defined before processing begins**
- Rework treated as new pattern lineage
- Memory preserved even when patterns fail

**R&D Value:**  
Late decisions are biased.

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Deposition processes
- Etching and selective removal
- Full metrology stacks
- Chemical waste handling

---

## Status
**Current:** Geometry discipline enforced, limits acknowledged  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Resolution honest  
✔ Alignment repeatable  
✔ Distortion understood

### Why SP005 Matters
This is where ambition meets constraint.

Only what survives alignment deserves to exist.
