## SP002 — Environmental Control & Cleanroom Infrastructure

### R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)
Environment is not background.  
It is the **first tool**.

Environmental sovereignty precedes all process control.
If the room lies, every atom lies.

---

## Core Environmental Targets (Design Envelope)

> These targets define the **capability ceiling**, not the default operating point.
> Early experimentation may operate inside looser bands by intent.

- Particle control to sub-micron relevance
- Directional airflow with enforced gradients
- Thermal stability measured in drift, not setpoint
- Humidity bounded by chemistry, not comfort
- Vibration reduced to spectral irrelevance
- Electromagnetic noise treated as corruption

**R&D Value:**  
Targets define possibility, not obligation.

---

## Phase 0 — Environmental Ontology & Envelope Definition  
*(Ontology before hardware)*

### Scope
- Coupled-variable mapping
- Zone definition and boundaries
- Maintenance access logic

### Doctrine
- Environmental variables treated as **coupled**, not independent
- **No maintenance pathway may ever cross Z1/Z2 clean zones**
- Envelope violations logged as contamination events

**R&D Value:**  
If access paths lie, controls cannot save you.

---

## Phase 1 — Air Filtration & Particle Control  
*(Particles before pressure)*

### Scope
- HEPA / ULPA filtration
- Pre-filters and staging
- Particle monitoring

### Doctrine
- **Filter loading state logged as contamination risk**
- Filter degradation tracked longitudinally
- Particle counts treated as narrative, not snapshots

**R&D Value:**  
Dirty filters lie quietly.

---

## Phase 2 — Pressure Differentials & Flow Direction  
*(Pressure before temperature)*

### Scope
- Differential pressure zoning
- One-way flow enforcement
- Pressure monitoring

### Doctrine
- **Pressure inversion events treated as contamination incidents**
- Flow direction treated as authority, not suggestion
- Recovery requires verification, not reset

**R&D Value:**  
Pressure decides where truth travels.

---

## Phase 3 — Thermal Control & Drift Suppression  
*(Temperature before humidity)*

### Scope
- Thermal zoning
- Drift suppression
- Heat source isolation

### Doctrine
- **Thermal stability evaluated spatially, not just temporally**
- Gradients treated as alignment defects
- Stability logged as data, not assumption

**R&D Value:**  
Atoms respond to gradients, not averages.

---

## Phase 4 — Humidity & Chemical Vapor Control  
*(Humidity before vibration)*

### Scope
- Humidity control
- Vapor detection
- Condensation prevention

### Doctrine
- **Chemical vapor breakthrough events logged even within safety limits**
- Humidity bounded by surface chemistry
- Vapor presence treated as contamination narrative

**R&D Value:**  
Corrosion begins before danger.

---

## Phase 5 — Vibration Isolation & Mechanical Stillness  
*(Vibration before EM)*

### Scope
- Structural isolation
- Active and passive damping
- Mechanical decoupling

### Doctrine
- **Vibration spectra logged, not just RMS values**
- Frequency content treated as first-class data
- Stillness requirements trump convenience

**R&D Value:**  
Atoms care about frequency.

---

## Phase 6 — Electromagnetic Shielding & Field Control  
*(EM before gases)*

### Scope
- Shielding
- Grounding strategies
- Field mapping

### Doctrine
- **Shielding effectiveness verified under tool power cycling**
- Transient EM events logged explicitly
- Fields treated as invisible contamination

**R&D Value:**  
EM noise hides in transitions.

---

## Phase 7 — Gas Management & Chemical Exhaust  
*(Containment over comfort)*

### Scope
- Process gases
- Exhaust routing
- Leak detection

### Doctrine
- **Gas purity verified at point-of-use**
- Exhaust integrity monitored continuously
- Pipes treated as potential contamination vectors

**R&D Value:**  
Pipes lie.

---

## Phase 8 — Monitoring, Alarms & Environmental Memory  
*(Awareness before memory)*

### Scope
- Sensor networks
- Alarm logic
- Environmental logs

### Doctrine
- **Environmental events time-correlated with SP009/SP010 failure and yield logs**
- Alarms trigger investigation, not dismissal
- Memory preserved across tool generations

**R&D Value:**  
Environment explains failure before tools do.

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Deposition equipment
- Lithography systems
- Metrology hardware
- Chemical recipes
- Process tooling

---

## Status
**Current:** Environmental enforcement doctrine locked  

**Next Gate:**  
✔ Authority enforced  
✔ Stillness verified  
✔ Truth preserved

### Why SP002 Matters
You cannot argue with atoms.

SP002 ensures they never have to.
