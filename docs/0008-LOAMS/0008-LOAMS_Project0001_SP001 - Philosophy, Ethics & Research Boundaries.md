## Philosophy, Ethics & Research Boundaries  
*Why We’re Allowed to Touch This*

---

## R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)

SP001 defines the **moral, physical, and epistemic limits** of LOAMS research **before** tools, energy, or ambition escalate.

LOAMS is not a sandbox.  
It is a controlled edge environment.

If SP001 is weak, everything downstream becomes suspect. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

---

## Core Principles (Immutable)

- Curiosity does not outrank safety  
- Nature is the senior engineer  
- Failure is data — secrecy is not  
- Nothing is owed production  
- Exit paths exist for every experiment :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

---

## Phase 0 — Research Ethos & Canon

### Pass-1 Accuracy / Correctness (Governance Requirements)
- A written LOAMS Charter must exist in:
  - plain language (human clarity)
  - formal language (audit-grade)
- Explicit non-extractive doctrine
- Environmental harm thresholds defined before experiments
- Human safety hierarchy made explicit
- Clear “do not pursue” categories

**Cost:** ~$500–$3k  
**R&D Value:** Prevents drifting into “because we can” thinking. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

---

## Phase 1 — Ethical Review & Red-Team Framework

### Pass-1 Refinement
- Critique must include:
  - internal review
  - external reviewer invitation rules
  - red-team escalation triggers
  - minority objection preservation
  - override conditions (who can veto, and why)

**Minimum viable cadence (Pass-1):**
- 1x **review board** meeting per month
- 1x **red-team** session per quarter
- ad-hoc escalation allowed any time

**Cost:** ~$1k–$6k  
**R&D Value:** The most dangerous ideas are the ones nobody challenges. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

---

## Phase 2 — Safety Envelope & Energy Boundaries

### Pass-1 Refinement
SP001 must set **bounded “energy permission”** for the lab:
- Max allowable energy density bounds (by class)
- Thermal, electrical, chemical thresholds
- Scale-up prohibition triggers
- Containment level taxonomy
- Kill-switch doctrine (physical + procedural)

**Correctness constraint:**  
> If an experiment cannot be safely stopped, it is not approved.

**Cost:** ~$2k–$12k  
**R&D Value:** Curiosity must never outrun containment. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

---

## Phase 3 — Experiment Classification System

### Pass-1 Refinement
Classification must be unambiguous and enforceable:
- Speculative vs exploratory vs applied
- Reversibility grading
- Environmental exposure rating
- Human proximity classification
- Automatic escalation rules

**Rule:**  
> Not all experiments deserve equal freedom.

**Cost:** ~$1k–$5k  
**R&D Value:** Reduces ambiguity-driven risk. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

---

## Phase 4 — Documentation & Transparency Standards

### Pass-1 Refinement
- Mandatory proposal template
- Public vs internal documentation separation
- Versioned hypothesis logs
- Change justification records
- “What changed and why” tracking

**Correctness constraint:**  
> No undocumented experiment is allowed to proceed.

**Cost:** ~$1k–$8k  
**R&D Value:** Opacity is how mistakes repeat. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

---

## Phase 5 — Ethics of Collaboration & Attribution

### Pass-1 Refinement
- Contributor rights charter
- Attribution guarantees
- Credit permanence rules
- Anti-appropriation clauses
- Exit rights for contributors

**Cost:** ~$500–$4k  
**R&D Value:** Trust scales faster than funding. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

---

## Phase 6 — Risk Acceptance & Termination Authority

### Pass-1 Refinement
- Who can halt a thread (named roles)
- How termination decisions are logged
- Emergency stop authority
- Safe teardown procedures
- Post-termination review

**Rule:**  
> The ability to stop is the real power.

**Cost:** ~$500–$3k  
**R&D Value:** Prevents escalation inertia. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

---

## Phase 7 — Interface Rules with Suns0lver Stack

### Pass-1 Refinement
Clear translation gates to:
- SPANCL
- MAM
- MIFF

Including:
- proof thresholds for promotion
- containment requirements for handoff
- ethics re-review on escalation
- production veto authority

**Rule:**  
> LOAMS informs — it does not dictate.

**Cost:** ~$500–$5k  
**R&D Value:** Prevents premature or unsafe downstream adoption. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

---

## Phase 8 — Archival, Legacy & Long-Term Stewardship

### Pass-1 Refinement
- Permanent archival formats
- Failure preservation rules
- Access tiers for future researchers
- Sunset clauses
- Knowledge inheritance doctrine

**Cost:** ~$500–$4k  
**R&D Value:** Some ideas should rest, not disappear. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

## Phase-X — Instant Buildout @ Market Costs (Added)

SP001 is “cheap” only if treated as paperwork.  
A credible SP001 requires **ongoing governance capacity**.

### X-A. Assumptions (Instant, Credible Launch)
- 1 active LOAMS thread intake lane
- 1 governance board with real authority
- 1 red-team function (internal + external access rules)
- Versioned documentation + archival policy active Day-1
- Kill authority & termination doctrine enforced

### X-B. Operational Cost Model (Pass-1)
Let:
- **T** = active threads per month (baseline: 4–10)
- **R** = review hours per thread (baseline: 2–6 hrs)
- **B** = board cadence per month (baseline: 1 meeting)
- **RT** = red-team cadence per quarter (baseline: 1 session)

**Monthly governance hours:**
- Thread review load ≈ **T × R**  
- Board time ≈ **6–12 hrs/month** (meeting + prep + decisions)
- Documentation QA ≈ **10–25 hrs/month**
- External reviewer coordination ≈ **2–10 hrs/month**

**Baseline monthly hours (T=6, R=4):**
- Thread review: 24 hrs
- Board + prep: 10 hrs
- Doc QA: 15 hrs
- External: 6 hrs  
**Total:** ~55 hrs/month

### X-C. Instant Buildout Cost (SP001 Only)

| Scenario | What It Represents | Annual Cost |
|---|---|---:|
| **Lean** | part-time governance + minimal external review | **$25k–$60k** |
| **Typical** | reliable cadence + some external critique | **$75k–$150k** |
| **Premium** | strong external review + formal audit posture | **$180k–$350k** |

> **Rule of thumb:**  
> A credible SP001 runs **$100k/year** when done seriously.

### X-D. Why This Matters
- Governance debt becomes safety debt
- Documentation debt becomes repeatability debt
- External critique prevents internal blind spots
- Termination authority prevents escalation traps
