## Closure, Archival & Legacy
*Ending Well · Preserving Truth · Leaving a Map*

---

## R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)

SP010 exists to ensure that **no LOAMS thread**:

- disappears without explanation
- mutates quietly over time
- leaves ambiguity for future readers
- wastes hard-won understanding

Closure is not failure.  
**Unclosed work is.** :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

Every LOAMS project must:
- end deliberately
- be explainable decades later
- leave behind usable knowledge
- make future work easier, not harder

---

## The Legacy Doctrine (Immutable)

- Every thread ends  
- Every ending is documented  
- Every lesson is preserved  
- Every failure is honored  
- Every future reader is respected :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

---

## Phase 0 — Formal Closure Declaration  
*This thread is done*

### Pass-1 Accuracy / Correctness
A formal closure record must include:

- Explicit closure statement
- Final scope confirmation
- Reason for closure (success, failure, pause, risk)
- Outstanding unknowns list
- Conditions for re-entry (if any)

**Correctness constraint:**  
> A project is not closed until closure is declared.

**Cost:** ~$500–$2k  
**R&D Value:** Prevents zombie projects. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

---

## Phase 1 — Final Synthesis & Narrative Record  
*What actually happened*

### Pass-1 Refinement
A human-readable synthesis must be produced:

- Plain-language summary
- Technical summary
- What worked / what failed
- What surprised us
- Early misunderstandings

**Rule:**  
> Future readers need context, not raw logs.

**Cost:** ~$1k–$5k  
**R&D Value:** Preserves understanding, not just data. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

---

## Phase 2 — Archival Packaging & Indexing  
*Knowledge that can be found*

### Pass-1 Accuracy
All materials must be packaged into a **canonical archive**:

- Stable directory structure
- Cross-linked documentation
- Persistent identifiers and hashes
- Metadata completeness checks
- Machine-readable indices

**Correctness constraint:**  
> If it cannot be found, it does not exist.

**Cost:** ~$2k–$10k  
**R&D Value:** Prevents knowledge loss through obscurity. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

---

## Phase 3 — Failure & Negative Results Preservation  
*The gold nobody wants to lose*

### Pass-1 Refinement
Failure is preserved deliberately:

- Dedicated failure summaries
- False-lead catalog
- “Do not repeat” flags
- Misleading signal documentation
- Disproven hypotheses list

**Rule:**  
> Negative results are future accelerators.

**Cost:** ~$1k–$6k  
**R&D Value:** Saves future researchers years. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

---

## Phase 4 — Attribution, Credit & Lineage  
*Giants’ shoulders acknowledged*

### Pass-1 Accuracy
Attribution must be explicit and durable:

- Contributor attribution map
- External influences and references
- Intellectual lineage notes
- Citation-ready acknowledgments
- Credit permanence guarantees

**Correctness constraint:**  
> Truth travels further when credit is clean.

**Cost:** ~$500–$4k  
**R&D Value:** Preserves trust across generations. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

---

## Phase 5 — Translation Outcomes Record  
*Where did this go — or not go*

### Pass-1 Refinement
A complete translation record includes:

- Translation attempts summary
- Downstream adoption (if any)
- Rejections and reasons
- Safety veto records
- Stack-impact assessment

**Rule:**  
> Silence about non-adoption creates false narratives.

**Cost:** ~$500–$3k  
**R&D Value:** Clarifies why work remained research-only. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

---

## Phase 6 — Ethical & Environmental Accounting  
*Did we leave a mark?*

### Pass-1 Accuracy
Final responsibility review must include:

- Environmental impact summary
- Energy and material accounting
- Safety incidents (if any)
- Ethical considerations revisited
- Confirmation of safe termination

**Correctness constraint:**  
> Closure includes responsibility.

**Cost:** ~$1k–$5k  
**R&D Value:** Ethics extend beyond execution. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

---

## Phase 7 — Long-Term Stewardship & Access Rules  
*Who can see this later?*

### Pass-1 Refinement
Long-term access must be defined:

- Access tier definitions
- Redaction rules
- Future release triggers
- Steward succession plan
- Preservation format standards

**Rule:**  
> Knowledge outlives organizations.

**Cost:** ~$1k–$6k  
**R&D Value:** Prevents archival rot and loss. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

---

## Phase 8 — Legacy Notes to Future Researchers  
*A message across time*

### Pass-1 Accuracy
A final message must be included:

- “If you pick this up again…” letter
- Known traps and warnings
- What we wish we had known
- Suggested next questions
- Encouragement without bias

**Rule:**  
> Wisdom is kindness to the future.

**Cost:** ~$500–$3k  
**R&D Value:** Transfers insight, not ego. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

## Phase-X — Instant Buildout @ Market Costs (Added)

SP010 is **process-heavy, not equipment-heavy**, but it is not optional.

### X-A. Assumptions (Credible Closure Capacity)
- 2–4 LOAMS threads closed per year
- Full archival and indexing discipline
- Attribution and ethics review enforced
- Long-term stewardship planned from Day-1

### X-B. Annual Workload Model (Pass-1)

- Closure synthesis & review: 30–60 hrs/thread  
- Archival & indexing: 20–40 hrs/thread  
- Attribution & ethics review: 10–20 hrs/thread  
- Stewardship setup & legacy writing: 10–25 hrs/thread  

**Annual hours:** ~140–290 hrs/year

### X-C. Instant Buildout Cost (SP010 Only)

| Scenario | Scope | Annual Cost |
|---|---|---:|
| **Lean** | minimal but complete closure | **$40k–$80k** |
| **Typical** | rich synthesis + archival | **$90k–$160k** |
| **Premium** | deep legacy & public stewardship | **$200k–$350k** |

> **Rule of thumb:**  
> A credible SP010 operates at **~$100k–$150k/year**.

### X-D. Why This Matters
- Unclosed work decays into myth
- Archives preserve acceleration
- Future researchers inherit clarity, not confusion
- Legacy is an engineering output
