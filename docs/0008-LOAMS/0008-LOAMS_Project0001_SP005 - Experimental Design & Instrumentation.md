## Experimental Design & Instrumentation
*Clean Experiments · Measurable Truth · Reproducibility Over Ego*

---

## R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)

SP005 ensures that every experiment can be **understood, repeated, criticized, and safely terminated**.

If SP003 asks *what emerges*  
and SP004 asks *where it breaks*,  
SP005 asks:

> **Did we actually test what we think we tested?** :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

---

## Discipline Doctrine (LOAMS Standard)

An experiment is valid only if all of the following are true:

- The question is explicit  
- Variables are isolated and declared  
- Instrumentation is calibrated  
- Data streams are time-aligned  
- Failure modes are observable  
- Results are reproducible or falsifiable

Anything less is not evidence. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

---

## Phase 0 — Hypothesis Framing & Experimental Intent
*What are we actually asking?*

### Pass-1 Accuracy / Correctness
- Mandatory hypothesis statement (primary + null)
- Independent/dependent variables declared
- Assumptions and boundary conditions listed
- Expected outcomes (including null)
- Explicit falsification criteria

**Correctness constraint:**  
> No experiment proceeds without a falsifiable hypothesis.

**Cost:** ~$500–$3k  
**R&D Value:** Prevents vague success criteria. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

---

## Phase 1 — Experimental Isolation & Control
*One thing changes at a time*

### Pass-1 Refinement
- Controlled environments (thermal/chemical/mechanical as applicable)
- Variable isolation protocols
- Control group or baseline requirement
- Noise source identification
- Cross-coupling minimization plan

**Rule:**  
> Uncontrolled coupling invalidates conclusions.

**Cost:** ~$3k–$20k  
**R&D Value:** Most bad science is uncontrolled coupling. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

---

## Phase 2 — Instrument Selection & Calibration
*Measure honestly or don’t measure*

### Pass-1 Accuracy
- Calibrated thermal sensors
- Electrical probes/meters with traceable calibration
- Mechanical strain/displacement sensors
- Optical/surface measurement tools
- Calibration schedules and records

**Correctness constraint:**  
> Uncalibrated instruments are not evidence.

**Cost:** ~$10k–$70k  
**R&D Value:** Uncalibrated instruments lie politely. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

---

## Phase 3 — Data Acquisition & Synchronization
*Time matters*

### Pass-1 Refinement
- Time-synchronized data logging
- Sampling-rate justification per signal
- Clock-drift detection and correction
- Event tagging/markers
- Raw data preservation policy

**Rule:**  
> Out-of-sync data creates false causality.

**Cost:** ~$5k–$40k  
**R&D Value:** Temporal alignment is causal integrity. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

---

## Phase 4 — Experimental Execution Protocols
*Run it the same way every time*

### Pass-1 Accuracy
- Step-by-step execution scripts
- Pre-flight safety checks
- Mid-run abort conditions
- Post-run cooldown/reset procedures
- Human intervention logging

**Rule:**  
> Consistency is a variable that must be controlled.

**Cost:** ~$2k–$15k  
**R&D Value:** Consistency is the hidden variable. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

---

## Phase 5 — Error Analysis & Uncertainty Quantification
*Admit what we don’t know*

### Pass-1 Refinement
- Measurement uncertainty tracking
- Error propagation analysis
- Sensor confidence scoring
- Repeatability variance analysis
- Signal-vs-noise discrimination

**Correctness constraint:**  
> Precision without uncertainty is fiction.

**Cost:** ~$3k–$25k  
**R&D Value:** Quantified doubt strengthens claims. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

---

## Phase 6 — Reproducibility & Replication Tests
*Truth survives repetition*

### Pass-1 Accuracy
- Independent repeat runs
- Operator-independent trials
- Blind condition tests where applicable
- Cross-instrument verification
- Reproduction scoring

**Rule:**  
> If it only works once, it does not work.

**Cost:** ~$3k–$30k  
**R&D Value:** Repetition separates signal from coincidence. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

---

## Phase 7 — Documentation, Review & Audit Trail
*Memory with integrity*

### Pass-1 Refinement
- Versioned experiment records
- Immutable raw-data logs
- Change-justification records
- Peer review annotations
- Critique response tracking

**Correctness constraint:**  
> If it is not documented, it did not happen.

**Cost:** ~$2k–$20k  
**R&D Value:** Trust lives in the paper trail. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

---

## Phase 8 — Instrumentation Safety & Failure Containment
*Tools must fail gracefully*

### Pass-1 Accuracy
- Instrument fault detection
- Automatic shutdown on sensor loss
- Redundant measurement paths
- Defined safe states
- Post-failure diagnostics

**Rule:**  
> Broken instruments must not break experiments.

**Cost:** ~$3k–$25k  
**R&D Value:** Safety preserves the dataset. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

## Phase-X — Instant Buildout @ Market Costs (Added)

SP005 requires **ongoing rigor**, not one-time purchases.

### X-A. Assumptions (Credible Day-1)
- 3–6 active experimental threads
- Calibrated, synchronized instrumentation
- Enforced protocols and audit trail
- No synthesis creep; measurement first

### X-B. Throughput Model (Pass-1)
Let:
- **E** = experiments/year (baseline: 30–60)
- **Hₑ** = hands-on hours/experiment (6–12)
- **Hₐ** = analysis & documentation hours/experiment (8–16)

**Annual hours:**
- Execution: 180–720 hrs  
- Analysis & docs: 240–960 hrs  
- QA, calibration, review: 200–400 hrs  

**Total:** ~620–2,080 hrs/year

### X-C. Instant Buildout Cost (SP005 Only)

| Scenario | Scope | Annual Cost |
|---|---|---:|
| **Lean** | basic calibration + limited sensors | **$90k–$150k** |
| **Typical** | full calibration, sync, audits | **$220k–$400k** |
| **Premium** | redundancy, cross-verification | **$500k–$850k** |

> **Rule of thumb:**  
> A credible SP005 runs **~$300k–$450k/year**.

### X-D. Why This Matters
- Instrument debt becomes truth debt
- Poor synchronization fabricates causality
- Reproducibility is the only durable claim
- Safety preserves continuity
