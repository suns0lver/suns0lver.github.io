## Failure Modes, Limits & Breakpoints  
*Rupture as Teacher · Boundaries as Signal · Truth Over Continuity*

---

## R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)

SP004 exists to **invalidate our own ideas before reality does it at scale**.

If SP003 asks:
> *What might emerge?*

SP004 asks:
> *Under what conditions does this stop being true?*

Failure here is not embarrassment.  
It is **measurement**. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

---

## Interpretive Spine — How LOAMS Treats Failure

Failure is treated as:
- a **map of constraints**
- a **translator between scales**
- a **guardian against narrative drift**

Every recorded failure must be:
- reproducible
- localized
- explained *or* bounded
- archived
- allowed to **terminate the thread**

If a failure cannot meet these conditions, the work does not proceed. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

---

## Core Principles (Immutable)

- Assume breakage  
- Stress **before** scale  
- Local failure is acceptable; cascading failure is not  
- Unknown failure modes outrank known ones in risk  
- If failure cannot be explained, progression stops :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

---

## Phase 0 — Failure Taxonomy & Language  
*Name the ways things fail*

### Pass-1 Accuracy / Correctness
A canonical failure language must exist **before experiments begin**:

- Failure domains: thermal, structural, chemical, informational, environmental
- Distinction between **mode**, **cause**, and **trigger**
- Reversible vs irreversible labeling
- Graceful vs catastrophic classification
- Confidence scoring for explanations

**Correctness constraint:**  
> No failure may be recorded without classification.

**Cost:** ~$1k–$6k  
**R&D Value:** You cannot fix what you cannot name. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

---

## Phase 1 — Stress Envelope Definition  
*Where pressure begins to matter*

### Pass-1 Refinement
Explicit envelopes must be defined and logged:

- Upper/lower thermal bounds
- Gradient steepness thresholds
- Time-at-condition limits
- Environmental coupling assumptions
- Human proximity constraints

**Rule:**  
> Work may not exceed defined envelopes without re-approval.

**Cost:** ~$2k–$15k  
**R&D Value:** Most systems fail at edges, not centers. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

---

## Phase 2 — Induced Failure Experiments  
*Break it on purpose*

### Pass-1 Refinement
Failure is induced **deliberately and repeatedly**:

- Controlled overload protocols
- Shock and rapid-change tests
- Boundary-condition violations
- Intentional asymmetry injection
- Repetition until consistency

**Rule:**  
> A one-off failure is not understanding.

**Cost:** ~$5k–$40k  
**R&D Value:** Intentional breakage teaches faster than accidents. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

---

## Phase 3 — Cascading Failure Analysis  
*How small breaks become large ones*

### Pass-1 Accuracy
Failure propagation must be explicitly mapped:

- Coupled-variable tracking
- Feedback loop identification
- Runaway condition detection
- Containment breach simulation
- Cross-system interaction analysis

**Constraint:**  
> Cascading failure without containment ends the thread.

**Cost:** ~$5k–$35k  
**R&D Value:** The scariest failures do not stay local. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

---

## Phase 4 — Scale Sensitivity & Translation Limits  
*What works small and lies big*

### Pass-1 Refinement
Scale effects must be tested, not assumed:

- Nonlinear behavior detection
- Surface-to-volume distortions
- Time-constant changes
- Energy density scaling limits
- Extrapolation invalidation tests

**Rule:**  
> Small-scale success does not justify scale-up.

**Cost:** ~$5k–$50k  
**R&D Value:** Scale is where most ideas fail quietly. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

---

## Phase 5 — Material & Interface Breakdown  
*Where matter refuses cooperation*

### Pass-1 Accuracy
Interfaces are tested before bulk claims:

- Phase-boundary instability
- Interface delamination
- Thermal fatigue and creep
- Contamination sensitivity
- Long-duration degradation

**Rule:**  
> Interfaces fail before materials.

**Cost:** ~$8k–$60k  
**R&D Value:** Most failures originate between things, not within them. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

---

## Phase 6 — Observability & Blind-Spot Detection  
*What failed before we noticed*

### Pass-1 Refinement
Detection limits are measured directly:

- Sensor lag and saturation analysis
- Resolution and aliasing limits
- Hidden-variable identification
- False-stability detection
- “Looks fine until it isn’t” cases

**Constraint:**  
> Unobserved failure is unacceptable risk.

**Cost:** ~$3k–$25k  
**R&D Value:** Blind spots are the most dangerous failures. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

---

## Phase 7 — Termination Criteria & Kill Conditions  
*When to stop — cleanly*

### Pass-1 Accuracy
Explicit termination authority must be defined:

- Hard stop thresholds
- Ethical escalation triggers
- Environmental risk vetoes
- Energy ceiling violations
- Named shutdown authority and logs

**Rule:**  
> The ability to stop is the highest form of control.

**Cost:** ~$1k–$10k  
**R&D Value:** Wisdom includes knowing when to quit. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

---

## Phase 8 — Failure Documentation & Public Memory  
*Preserve the scars*

### Pass-1 Refinement
Every failure produces durable record:

- Structured failure reports
- Timeline of degradation and rupture
- “What fooled us” analysis
- Lessons-learned summaries
- Cross-links to future threads

**Rule:**  
> Forgotten failures repeat.

**Cost:** ~$2k–$15k  
**R&D Value:** Memory is a safety system. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}

## Phase-X — Instant Buildout @ Market Costs (Added)

SP004 is not optional overhead.  
It is the **primary safety SP** for LOAMS.

### X-A. Assumptions (Credible Day-1 Operation)
- 3–6 active research threads under review
- Induced failure testing permitted at bounded energy
- Independent termination authority active
- Full archival and cross-thread visibility
- No production intent

### X-B. Annual Throughput Model (Pass-1)
Let:
- **F** = failure campaigns/year (baseline: 15–30)
- **Hₑ** = experimental hours/campaign (6–15)
- **Hₐ** = analysis & documentation hours/campaign (6–18)

**Annual hours:**
- Induced failure testing: 90–450 hrs  
- Analysis & reporting: 90–540 hrs  
- Oversight, review, archiving: 120–300 hrs  

**Total:** ~300–1,300 hrs/year

### X-C. Instant Buildout Cost (SP004 Only)

| Scenario | Scope | Annual Cost |
|---|---|---:|
| **Lean** | basic failure taxonomy + limited testing | **$70k–$130k** |
| **Typical** | full envelope + cascade analysis | **$180k–$350k** |
| **Premium** | deep scale-limit + observability work | **$450k–$800k** |

> **Rule of thumb:**  
> A credible SP004 runs **~$250k–$350k/year**.

### X-D. Why This Matters
- Unknown failure modes are existential risk
- Cascades must be caught early
- Scale-up without failure mapping is negligence
- Termination authority preserves the whole stack
