## Simulation, Modeling & Counterfactuals
*Test Reality Before Reality Tests Us*

---

## R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)

SP006 exists to **stress ideas in silico before stressing matter** and to ask the questions experiments often cannot:

- What if the opposite were true?
- What if a core assumption fails?
- What would we expect to observe if we are wrong?
- Where does reality historically diverge from mathematics?

Simulation **never replaces experiment**.  
It exists to **protect** experiment. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

---

## Counterfactual Doctrine (LOAMS Standard)

Every model must explicitly answer:

- What assumptions does this depend on?
- What breaks if those assumptions are wrong?
- What result would falsify the model?
- What behavior is the model blind to?
- Where does reality historically disagree with this math?

A model that cannot be wrong is not informative. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## Phase 0 — Modeling Scope & Assumption Control
*Know what you are pretending*

### Pass-1 Accuracy / Correctness
- Explicit assumption registers (enumerated, versioned)
- Parameter bounding definitions
- Known-unknown and unknown-unknown tagging
- “Unmodeled effects” declarations
- Scope-creep prevention rules

**Correctness constraint:**  
> No model may proceed without a declared assumption register.

**Cost:** ~$500–$4k  
**R&D Value:** Most bad models fail silently at the assumptions layer. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

---

## Phase 1 — Physics-Based Modeling Toolchain
*Start with first principles*

### Pass-1 Refinement
- Thermal diffusion & gradient solvers
- Phase-transition modeling
- Reaction–diffusion frameworks
- Coupled-field simulation (thermal / mechanical / chemical)
- Preference for open, inspectable solvers

**Rule:**  
> Black-box solvers require justification and inspection paths.

**Cost:** ~$10k–$80k  
**R&D Value:** Black boxes hide bad physics. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

---

## Phase 2 — Sensitivity & Parameter Sweep Analysis
*Which knobs actually matter?*

### Pass-1 Accuracy
- Automated parameter sweeps
- Sensitivity ranking
- Nonlinear response detection
- Stability basin mapping
- Bifurcation identification

**Rule:**  
> Robust systems do not hinge on a single knob.

**Cost:** ~$5k–$40k  
**R&D Value:** Fragility hides in ignored parameters. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

---

## Phase 3 — Failure Boundary & Limit Modeling
*Where the math snaps*

### Pass-1 Refinement
- Limit-state identification
- Instability onset detection
- Runaway condition modeling
- Phase-boundary collapse mapping
- Catastrophic vs graceful failure differentiation

**Correctness constraint:**  
> Failure boundaries must be predicted before experiments approach them.

**Cost:** ~$8k–$60k  
**R&D Value:** Failure boundaries should be predicted, not discovered. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

---

## Phase 4 — Counterfactual & Null-Hypothesis Testing
*Assume we are wrong*

### Pass-1 Accuracy
- Null-model generation
- Opposing-hypothesis simulations
- Randomized initial-condition testing
- Noise-dominated regime modeling
- Explicit “nothing happens” baselines

**Rule:**  
> Models must lose gracefully.

**Cost:** ~$5k–$35k  
**R&D Value:** Counterfactuals expose narrative bias. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

---

## Phase 5 — Model–Experiment Alignment
*Where theory meets matter*

### Pass-1 Refinement
- Simulation/experiment overlays
- Error-envelope comparison
- Divergence detection metrics
- Model-revision triggers
- Assumption update logs

**Correctness constraint:**  
> Disagreement triggers revision, not explanation.

**Cost:** ~$5k–$30k  
**R&D Value:** Disagreement is information. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

---

## Phase 6 — Computational Reproducibility & Traceability
*Same inputs, same outputs*

### Pass-1 Accuracy
- Versioned model configurations
- Deterministic run options
- Seed control and logging
- Automated reruns
- Environment capture (dependencies, libraries)

**Rule:**  
> If the model cannot be rerun, it cannot be trusted.

**Cost:** ~$3k–$20k  
**R&D Value:** Reproducibility is credibility. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

---

## Phase 7 — Visualization & Interpretability
*See the truth*

### Pass-1 Refinement
- Time-evolution visualizations
- Gradient and field mapping
- Phase-space plots
- Failure-onset indicators
- Human-readable outputs by default

**Rule:**  
> If you cannot see it, you will misread it.

**Cost:** ~$5k–$40k  
**R&D Value:** Visualization prevents misinterpretation. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

---

## Phase 8 — Modeling Ethics & Overreach Guards
*Math does not grant permission*

### Pass-1 Accuracy
- Explicit “model ≠ reality” warnings
- Scale-up veto rules
- Model-only conclusion flags
- Mandatory experimental confirmation gates
- Archival of disproven models

**Correctness constraint:**  
> No model result authorizes escalation on its own.

**Cost:** ~$500–$5k  
**R&D Value:** Models are advisors, not authorities. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

## Phase-X — Instant Buildout @ Market Costs (Added)

SP006 is computationally modest but **discipline-heavy**.

### X-A. Assumptions (Credible Day-1 Operation)
- 3–6 active modeling threads
- Explicit assumption registers
- Counterfactual testing mandatory
- Tight experiment-alignment loops
- No production inference

### X-B. Throughput Model (Pass-1)
Let:
- **M** = models/year (baseline: 25–50)
- **Hₘ** = modeling hours/model (10–30)
- **Hₐ** = analysis & documentation hours/model (8–20)

**Annual hours:**
- Modeling runs: 250–1,500 hrs  
- Analysis & documentation: 200–1,000 hrs  
- Review & reproducibility overhead: 150–350 hrs  

**Total:** ~600–2,850 hrs/year

### X-C. Instant Buildout Cost (SP006 Only)

| Scenario | Scope | Annual Cost |
|---|---|---:|
| **Lean** | basic solvers + limited sweeps | **$80k–$150k** |
| **Typical** | robust toolchain + counterfactuals | **$200k–$400k** |
| **Premium** | high-fidelity, deep sensitivity | **$450k–$800k** |

> **Rule of thumb:**  
> A credible SP006 operates at **~$300k–$450k/year**.

### X-D. Why This Matters
- Assumption debt becomes experiment debt
- Scale-up without counterfactuals is reckless
- Modeling exposes blind spots cheaply
- Falsifiability preserves humility
