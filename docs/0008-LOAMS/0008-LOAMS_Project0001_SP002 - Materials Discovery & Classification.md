## Materials Discovery & Classification  
*What Exists · What Might · What Was Forgotten*

---

## R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)

SP002 exists to **observe, catalog, and understand materials before attempting to change them**.

LOAMS does not begin with synthesis.  
It begins with **listening to matter**.

This SP creates the shared language that enables:
- critique without confusion
- experimentation without repetition
- collaboration without collapse :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

---

## Core Principles (Immutable)

- Classification **precedes** invention  
- Observation **outranks** modification  
- Old materials deserve the same respect as new ones  
- If we cannot name it, we cannot improve it  
- Unknown ≠ impossible :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

---

## Phase 0 — Taxonomy & Classification Framework

### Pass-1 Accuracy / Correctness
A canonical taxonomy must be established **before** data intake:

- Material families: metals, ceramics, polymers, composites, bio-materials, hybrids  
- Scale tags: nano / micro / macro / structural  
- State tags: crystalline, amorphous, meta-stable, phase-change  
- Origin tags: natural, synthetic, ancient technique, speculative  
- Confidence levels: well-known → poorly understood

**Correctness constraint:**  
> No material may be referenced without a minimum taxonomy footprint.

**Cost:** ~$1k–$5k  
**R&D Value:** Prevents semantic chaos and false novelty. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

---

## Phase 1 — Reference Materials & Baseline Library

### Pass-1 Refinement
A baseline library establishes *known truth*:

- Certified reference samples (metals, alloys, polymers)  
- Geological & naturally occurring materials  
- Historical / ancient materials (bronzes, steels, glasses, mortars)  
- Failure-known samples (fatigued, corroded, fractured)  
- Controlled storage & labeling system

**Rule:**  
> “New” claims require comparison against curated “old.”

**Cost:** ~$5k–$30k  
**R&D Value:** You can’t claim new without knowing old. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

---

## Phase 2 — Characterization & Basic Property Measurement

### Pass-1 Measurement Bounds
Only **basic, non-destructive** characterization is allowed here:

- Density & porosity  
- Thermal conductivity & expansion  
- Electrical conductivity  
- Hardness & wear  
- Optical & surface inspection

**Correctness constraint:**  
> Vendor spec sheets are never primary data.

**Cost:** ~$10k–$80k  
**R&D Value:** Spec sheets lie; measurements don’t. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

---

## Phase 3 — Structural, Morphological & Phase Analysis

### Pass-1 Refinement
Focus is on **organization**, not performance claims:

- Grain structure analysis  
- Bounded phase identification  
- Surface topology measurement  
- Internal structure inspection (NDE preferred)  
- Crystallinity vs disorder mapping

**Rule:**  
> Structure explains behavior, not the reverse.

**Cost:** ~$15k–$120k  
**R&D Value:** Structure explains behavior. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

---

## Phase 4 — Environmental & Stress Response Mapping

### Pass-1 Accuracy
Observe *response*, not failure engineering:

- Thermal cycling exposure  
- Humidity & corrosion testing  
- Mechanical stress screening  
- Bounded radiation / UV exposure  
- Aging & degradation observation

**Correctness constraint:**  
> Escalation to destructive testing requires SP004 approval.

**Cost:** ~$10k–$100k  
**R&D Value:** Most materials fail slowly before loudly. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

---

## Phase 5 — Bio-Inspired & Naturally Occurring Materials

### Pass-1 Refinement
Nature is treated as a **reference library**, not a quarry:

- Biominerals & shells  
- Plant-derived structural materials  
- Bone, wood, fiber composites  
- Self-healing natural analogs  
- Sustainable material exemplars

**Rule:**  
> Nature is observed, not extracted.

**Cost:** ~$5k–$40k  
**R&D Value:** Nature already solved problems we overcomplicate. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

---

## Phase 6 — Exotic, Extreme & Edge-Case Materials

### Pass-1 Boundaries
Curiosity is allowed with strict restraint:

- High-temperature materials  
- Ultra-lightweight structures  
- High-entropy alloys (reference only)  
- Meta-materials (classification focus)  
- Non-intuitive property materials

**Correctness constraint:**  
> Classification here does not imply feasibility.

**Cost:** ~$10k–$150k  
**R&D Value:** The edge of the map must be labeled carefully. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

---

## Phase 7 — Documentation, Metadata & Traceability

### Pass-1 Refinement
Every material entry must include:

- Machine-readable records  
- Provenance tracking  
- Measurement confidence scoring  
- Cross-links to references & failures  
- Versioned classification updates

**Rule:**  
> Untracked knowledge evaporates.

**Cost:** ~$2k–$15k  
**R&D Value:** Memory is half the work. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

---

## Phase 8 — Translation Flags & Stack Interfaces

### Pass-1 Accuracy
Discovery ≠ deployment.  
This phase sets **signals, not commitments**:

- Potential relevance flags for:
  - SPANCL (processability)
  - MAM (assemblability)
  - MIFF (structural viability)
  - NTIPS (energy behavior)
  - EBOPFS (bio compatibility)
- Explicit non-promotion labels  
- Re-review triggers on new data

**Rule:**  
> No material advances without re-classification.

**Cost:** ~$1k–$8k  
**R&D Value:** Discovery is not deployment. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

## Phase-X — Instant Buildout @ Market Costs (Added)

SP002 appears inexpensive until it is done **at scale and with rigor**.

### X-A. Assumptions (Credible Day-1 Launch)
- 100–300 material entries/year  
- Non-destructive focus  
- No synthesis or performance claims  
- Strong metadata + archival discipline

### X-B. Throughput Model (Pass-1)
Let:
- **M** = materials/year (baseline: 200)
- **H** = characterization hours/material (baseline: 3–6)
- **D** = documentation hours/material (baseline: 2–4)

**Annual hours:**
- Measurement: 600–1,200 hrs  
- Documentation & QA: 400–800 hrs  
- Taxonomy & review overhead: 150–300 hrs  

**Total:** ~1,150–2,300 hrs/year

### X-C. Instant Buildout Cost (SP002 Only)

| Scenario | Scope | Annual Cost |
|---|---|---:|
| **Lean** | small library, minimal instruments | **$60k–$120k** |
| **Typical** | solid library + core instruments | **$150k–$300k** |
| **Premium** | broad library + strong traceability | **$350k–$650k** |

> **Rule of thumb:**  
> A credible SP002 operates at **$200k–$300k/year**.

### X-D. Why This Matters
- Classification debt becomes research debt  
- Poor baselines create false novelty  
- Strong metadata prevents repeated mistakes  
- Downstream SPs rely on this truth layer
