## Collaboration, Critique & External Review
*Open Doors · Strong Spine · Signal Over Noise*

---

## R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)

SP008 exists to ensure LOAMS remains:

- open to critique  
- resistant to capture  
- legible to humans and machines  
- safe for dissent  

This SP is **not** about growth, consensus, or popularity.

It is about **signal quality**. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

---

## Collaboration Doctrine (Immutable)

- Critique is a form of contribution  
- Disagreement is preserved, not averaged  
- Authority emerges from argument, not status  
- No anonymous extraction of ideas  
- Participation does **not** imply endorsement :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

---

## Phase 0 — Contribution Entry Standards  
*Who may speak, and how*

### Pass-1 Accuracy / Correctness
All contributions must meet minimum structure requirements:

- Typed submission templates (idea / critique / reference / failure)
- Explicit scope declaration
- Conflict-of-interest disclosure
- Required linkage to existing threads
- Machine-readable metadata (IDs, timestamps, tags)

**Correctness constraint:**  
> Unstructured input is not critique; it is noise.

**Cost:** ~$500–$3k  
**R&D Value:** Keeps contributions legible and sortable. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

---

## Phase 1 — Critique Intake & Routing  
*Where feedback actually goes*

### Pass-1 Refinement
A centralized intake system must provide:

- Unified critique queue
- Topic-based routing (materials / physics / ethics / scale)
- Thread-level attachment (no orphan commentary)
- Immutable chronological logging
- Persistent contributor identity

**Rule:**  
> If feedback cannot be routed, it cannot be acted on.

**Cost:** ~$1k–$8k  
**R&D Value:** Prevents feedback from dissolving into chaos. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

---

## Phase 2 — Orthogonal Critique Filters  
*Extracting signal without censorship*

### Pass-1 Accuracy
Critiques are filtered and cross-referenced via:

- Tag-based lenses:
  - assumptions
  - materials
  - failure modes
  - scaling limits
  - ethics
- Reference-by-ID (no duplication)
- Cross-thread comparison
- Highlighting of unresolved critiques

**Rule:**  
> Truth appears in patterns, not comment counts.

**Cost:** ~$1k–$10k  
**R&D Value:** Enables synthesis without silencing. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

---

## Phase 3 — Reviewer Roles & Weighting  
*Not all feedback is equal — transparently*

### Pass-1 Refinement
Reviewer metadata must include:

- Role taxonomy (practitioner / theorist / skeptic / historian)
- Self-declared expertise areas
- Visible critique history
- Weighting without exclusion
- Minority-opinion preservation

**Correctness constraint:**  
> Weighting may influence visibility, never existence.

**Cost:** ~$500–$6k  
**R&D Value:** Prevents popularity from masquerading as correctness. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

---

## Phase 4 — Disagreement Preservation & Forking  
*Let ideas split cleanly*

### Pass-1 Accuracy
Formal mechanisms for dissent include:

- Explicit dissent markers
- Forkable interpretation paths
- Parallel hypothesis tracking
- “We disagree here” annotations
- Independent outcome tracking

**Rule:**  
> Premature consensus kills discovery.

**Cost:** ~$1k–$8k  
**R&D Value:** Protects minority truths. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

---

## Phase 5 — External Review & Red-Team Engagement  
*Invite the breakers*

### Pass-1 Refinement
External critique is structured, not performative:

- Red-team call protocols
- Expert invitations with scope limits
- Bounded critique windows
- Adversarial framing by design
- Mandatory public response logs

**Correctness constraint:**  
> If outsiders cannot challenge it, it is not yet real.

**Cost:** ~$1k–$12k  
**R&D Value:** External pressure exposes blind spots. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

---

## Phase 6 — Attribution, Credit & Anti-Extraction  
*No idea laundering*

### Pass-1 Accuracy
Contributor protection mechanisms include:

- Persistent contributor IDs
- Attribution locking
- Citation requirements
- Anti-appropriation clauses
- Explicit reuse permissions

**Rule:**  
> Trust is a technical system.

**Cost:** ~$500–$5k  
**R&D Value:** Prevents silent extraction of value. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

---

## Phase 7 — Moderation Without Authority Abuse  
*Guardrails, not gatekeepers*

### Pass-1 Refinement
Moderation must be:

- Rule-bound and published
- Focused on behavior, not ideas
- Appealable
- Fully logged
- Free of silent deletions

**Correctness constraint:**  
> Power must leave a paper trail.

**Cost:** ~$500–$4k  
**R&D Value:** Prevents quiet capture. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

---

## Phase 8 — Public Transparency Layer  
*Open without being sloppy*

### Pass-1 Accuracy
Public-facing views may include:

- Read-only access layers
- Redacted safety-sensitive sections
- Contribution summaries
- Critique heatmaps
- “Open questions” dashboards

**Rule:**  
> Transparency must not compromise safety.

**Cost:** ~$1k–$8k  
**R&D Value:** Builds trust without spectacle. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

## Phase-X — Instant Buildout @ Market Costs (Added)

SP008 is **process-heavy**, not equipment-heavy.

### X-A. Assumptions (Credible Day-1 Operation)
- 1–3 active LOAMS threads under review
- Continuous critique intake
- External reviewers engaged quarterly
- Dissent and forking enabled by default
- Public read-only layer active

### X-B. Throughput Model (Pass-1)
Let:
- **C** = critiques/month (baseline: 20–40)
- **Hᶜ** = handling hours/critique (0.5–1.5)
- **Hʳ** = review & synthesis hours/month (10–25)

**Annual hours:**
- Intake & routing: 120–720 hrs  
- Review & synthesis: 120–300 hrs  
- External coordination: 60–150 hrs  
- Moderation & transparency: 80–160 hrs  

**Total:** ~380–1,330 hrs/year

### X-C. Instant Buildout Cost (SP008 Only)

| Scenario | Scope | Annual Cost |
|---|---|---:|
| **Lean** | internal critique + light external | **$60k–$110k** |
| **Typical** | active external review & transparency | **$140k–$250k** |
| **Premium** | heavy red-team + public tooling | **$300k–$500k** |

> **Rule of thumb:**  
> A credible SP008 operates at **~$180k–$250k/year**.

### X-D. Why This Matters
- Unstructured critique degrades signal
- Silenced dissent reappears as failure
- Attribution prevents exploitation
- Transparency deters capture
