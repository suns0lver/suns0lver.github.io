## Safety, Containment & Escalation Control
*Nothing Proceeds Without a Way to Stop*

---

## R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)

SP009 exists to ensure that **no LOAMS activity can**:

- escalate silently
- exceed its authorization
- propagate uncontrolled
- endanger people, ecology, or the Suns0lver stack

This is not paranoia.  
This is **professional curiosity with brakes**. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

---

## The Containment Doctrine (Immutable)

- Every experiment has a **maximum allowed state**
- Every system has a **defined safe state**
- Every escalation has an **approval boundary**
- Every boundary has a **kill condition**
- Every kill condition is **testable**

**Rule:**  
> If you cannot stop it cleanly, you do not start it. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

---

## Phase 0 — Hazard Classification & Risk Envelope  
*Know what kind of danger you’re dealing with*

### Pass-1 Accuracy / Correctness
Each experiment must be classified before approval:

- Hazard taxonomy:
  - thermal
  - chemical
  - mechanical
  - energetic
  - informational
- Severity × likelihood scoring
- Exposure radius definition (human, environmental, infrastructural)
- Reversibility assessment
- Explicit risk-class assignment

**Correctness constraint:**  
> Unclassified hazards invalidate approval.

**Cost:** ~$1k–$6k  
**R&D Value:** Prevents category errors before they cost lives. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

---

## Phase 1 — Physical Containment Infrastructure  
*Walls that mean something*

### Pass-1 Refinement
Containment must be **physical first**, procedural second:

- Modular containment chambers
- Pressure- and temperature-rated enclosures
- Fire suppression and inerting systems
- Isolation mounts and blast deflection
- Passive, safety-first layouts

**Rule:**  
> Containment should not rely on heroics.

**Cost:** ~$10k–$120k  
**R&D Value:** Physical limits do not argue back. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

---

## Phase 2 — Energy & Scale Limitation Controls  
*Hard ceilings, not suggestions*

### Pass-1 Accuracy
- Maximum energy density governors
- Thermal ramp-rate limits
- Mass and volume caps
- Scale-up prohibition locks
- Physical interlocks tied to size and energy

**Correctness constraint:**  
> Scale requires explicit re-authorization.

**Cost:** ~$5k–$60k  
**R&D Value:** Most disasters are scale mistakes. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

---

## Phase 3 — Instrumented Monitoring & Early Warning  
*See failure coming*

### Pass-1 Refinement
- Real-time thermal, pressure, and strain sensors
- Independent watchdog sensors
- Alarm thresholds with escalation ladders
- Drift and anomaly detection
- Redundant sensing paths

**Rule:**  
> You react to warnings, not explosions.

**Cost:** ~$8k–$80k  
**R&D Value:** Detection beats response. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

---

## Phase 4 — Kill-Switches, Interlocks & Abort Logic  
*Stopping must be faster than thinking*

### Pass-1 Accuracy
- Physical, human-accessible kill switches
- Automated abort logic
- Sensor-failure-triggered shutdown
- Fail-closed system design
- Named manual override authority

**Correctness constraint:**  
> If software freezes, physics still listens.

**Cost:** ~$3k–$40k  
**R&D Value:** Fast stops prevent permanent consequences. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

---

## Phase 5 — Escalation Authority & Approval Gates  
*Who can say yes — and no*

### Pass-1 Refinement
- Defined escalation thresholds
- Named approval roles
- Multi-signature advancement rules
- Ethics veto precedence
- Logged authorization trails

**Rule:**  
> No single person outranks safety.

**Cost:** ~$1k–$8k  
**R&D Value:** Distributed authority prevents rash escalation. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

---

## Phase 6 — Incident Response & Containment Breach Protocols  
*When things go wrong*

### Pass-1 Accuracy
- Incident classification playbooks
- Immediate response procedures
- Containment recovery steps
- External notification criteria
- Mandatory post-incident review

**Correctness constraint:**  
> Every incident produces institutional memory.

**Cost:** ~$2k–$15k  
**R&D Value:** Preparedness shortens damage tails. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

---

## Phase 7 — Shutdown, Teardown & Safe Disposal  
*Ending cleanly*

### Pass-1 Refinement
- Controlled shutdown procedures
- De-energization protocols
- Safe material neutralization
- Waste handling and environmental controls
- Verification of safe state

**Rule:**  
> Experiments should end quieter than they began.

**Cost:** ~$3k–$25k  
**R&D Value:** Clean endings prevent lingering risk. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

---

## Phase 8 — Drills, Audits & Continuous Validation  
*Trust, but verify — forever*

### Pass-1 Accuracy
- Kill-switch testing schedules
- Containment drills
- Third-party safety audits
- Assumption re-checks
- Protocol revision triggers

**Correctness constraint:**  
> Untested safety systems are theater.

**Cost:** ~$2k–$20k  
**R&D Value:** Safety decays without rehearsal. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

## Phase-X — Instant Buildout @ Market Costs (Added)

SP009 is **infrastructure-heavy but non-negotiable**.

### X-A. Assumptions (Credible Day-1 Operation)
- 3–6 active LOAMS threads
- Bounded-energy experiments only
- Physical containment in place
- Kill authority always available
- Continuous audit posture

### X-B. Operational Load Model (Pass-1)

- Safety oversight: 10–20 hrs/month  
- Drill & audit overhead: 6–12 hrs/month  
- Incident readiness & review: 4–8 hrs/month  

**Annual hours:** ~240–480 hrs/year

### X-C. Instant Buildout Cost (SP009 Only)

| Scenario | Scope | Annual Cost |
|---|---|---:|
| **Lean** | core containment + drills | **$90k–$160k** |
| **Typical** | full containment + audits | **$200k–$350k** |
| **Premium** | multi-layer containment & red-team safety | **$450k–$700k** |

> **Rule of thumb:**  
> A credible SP009 operates at **~$250k–$350k/year**.

### X-D. Why This Matters
- Unstoppable systems become liabilities
- Kill authority preserves the entire stack
- Drills convert theory into reflex
- Containment is civilization’s quiet triumph

## SP009 Rule of LOAMS

If we cannot stop it instantly,  
we do not deserve to start it.
