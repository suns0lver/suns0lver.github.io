## Translation Paths to the Suns0lver Stack
*Insight → Capability · Curiosity → Craft · No Forced Promotion*

---

## R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)

SP007 defines **how — and whether — LOAMS outputs may move into production-facing domains**.

LOAMS does not ship products.  
LOAMS offers **candidates**.

Every translation is:
- optional
- gated
- reviewable
- reversible

Silence (no translation) is a valid and respected outcome. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

---

## Translation Doctrine (Immutable)

- Discovery does **not** imply deployment  
- Each downstream domain has **absolute veto authority**  
- Ethics are re-evaluated at **every handoff**  
- Translation must **reduce risk**, not amplify it  
- No domain inherits liability without consent :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

---

## Phase 0 — Translation Eligibility Criteria  
*What even qualifies for consideration?*

### Pass-1 Accuracy / Correctness
A LOAMS output may enter translation review only if it meets **all** of the following:

- Minimum evidence thresholds defined and met  
- Reproducibility demonstrated (or explicitly bounded)  
- Known failure modes documented  
- Containment and safety validated  
- Explicit list of unknowns maintained  

**Correctness constraint:**  
> An incomplete understanding is acceptable; undocumented ignorance is not.

**Cost:** ~$500–$4k  
**R&D Value:** Prevents half-formed ideas from escaping the lab. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

---

## Phase 1 — Domain Mapping & Relevance Flags  
*Where could this belong?*

### Pass-1 Refinement
Translation candidates are tagged (non-exclusively) against downstream domains:

- **SPANCL** — processable chemistry, surfaces, treatments  
- **MAM** — assemblable micro-systems or devices  
- **MIFF** — structural or force-bearing relevance  
- **NTIPS** — energy, thermal, or power behavior  
- **EBOPFS** — biological or environmental interaction  

Additional flags:
- multi-domain relevance permitted  
- explicit “no clear home” designation allowed  

**Rule:**  
> Relevance must be explained, not implied.

**Cost:** ~$1k–$6k  
**R&D Value:** Forces clarity about why something matters. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

---

## Phase 2 — Translation Readiness Review  
*Are we lying to ourselves?*

### Pass-1 Accuracy
A cross-domain review evaluates:

- Scale-up risk vs lab conditions  
- Failure modes under domain-specific stresses  
- Environmental and ethical re-assessment  
- Risk delta (LOAMS → domain)  

**Outcomes are limited to:**
- proceed
- hold
- reject
- archive

**Correctness constraint:**  
> “Proceed” requires explicit justification; “reject” requires explicit reasoning.

**Cost:** ~$2k–$15k  
**R&D Value:** Most bad deployments skip this step. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

---

## Phase 3 — Knowledge Package Construction  
*What gets handed off*

### Pass-1 Refinement
If approved to proceed, LOAMS produces a **translation package**:

- Concise technical brief  
- Assumptions and limits summary  
- Known incompatibilities  
- Monitoring and failure indicators  
- Explicit “do not use for” declarations  

**Rule:**  
> Downstream teams receive truth, not optimism.

**Cost:** ~$1k–$10k  
**R&D Value:** Prevents misinterpretation and misuse. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

---

## Phase 4 — Controlled Pilot Integration  
*Small, reversible steps*

### Pass-1 Accuracy
All translations begin as **bounded pilots**:

- Sandbox or isolated integration environments  
- Limited-scope prototypes  
- Energy, scale, and exposure caps  
- Defined rollback procedures  
- Instrumented monitoring hooks  

**Correctness constraint:**  
> Translation must be reversible without collateral damage.

**Cost:** ~$5k–$40k  
**R&D Value:** Translation should be testable, not dramatic. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

---

## Phase 5 — Feedback Loop & Bidirectional Learning  
*Reality talks back*

### Pass-1 Refinement
Downstream domains are required to report:

- Performance relative to expectations  
- Unexpected interactions or degradations  
- Translation failures (partial or full)  
- Conditions that invalidated assumptions  

Feedback triggers:
- iteration back into LOAMS  
- revision of classification or limits  
- termination or archival  

**Rule:**  
> LOAMS must learn from the stack it informs.

**Cost:** ~$1k–$10k  
**R&D Value:** Prevents one-way knowledge leakage. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

---

## Phase 6 — Translation Rejection & Archival  
*No shame in “not yet”*

### Pass-1 Accuracy
Rejection is treated as a **first-class outcome**:

- Formal rejection record  
- Reason-for-rejection taxonomy  
- Conditions for reconsideration (if any)  
- Long-term archival with citations  

**Correctness constraint:**  
> Rejected ideas remain searchable and citable.

**Cost:** ~$500–$3k  
**R&D Value:** Many good ideas mature later. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

---

## Phase 7 — Governance, Authority & Overrides  
*Who can say no*

### Pass-1 Refinement
Governance rules must be explicit:

- Domain-specific veto authorities  
- Ethics override precedence  
- Emergency halt powers  
- Documentation of dissent  
- Appeal and review paths  

**Rule:**  
> Restraint must be empowered, not implied.

**Cost:** ~$500–$4k  
**R&D Value:** Good systems prevent regret. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

---

## Phase 8 — Public Transparency & Attribution  
*Credit without confusion*

### Pass-1 Accuracy
Public-facing translation artifacts must include:

- Attribution guarantees  
- Clear “research origin” markers  
- Non-endorsement language  
- Contributor recognition  
- No implication of readiness beyond scope  

**Correctness constraint:**  
> Transparency must not imply production endorsement.

**Cost:** ~$500–$5k  
**R&D Value:** Trust survives handoffs. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

## Phase-X — Instant Buildout @ Market Costs (Added)

SP007 is governance-heavy, not equipment-heavy.

### X-A. Assumptions (Credible Day-1 Operation)
- 4–8 translation candidates/year  
- Active interfaces with SPANCL, MAM, MIFF, NTIPS, EBOPFS  
- Enforced veto and rollback authority  
- Documentation and archival active from Day-1  

### X-B. Throughput Model (Pass-1)
Let:
- **T** = translation candidates/year (baseline: 6)
- **Hᵣ** = review hours/candidate (6–12)
- **Hₚ** = package + pilot hours/candidate (8–20)

**Annual hours:**
- Review & governance: 36–72 hrs  
- Knowledge packaging: 48–120 hrs  
- Pilot oversight & feedback: 60–180 hrs  
- Archival & public disclosure: 30–60 hrs  

**Total:** ~175–430 hrs/year

### X-C. Instant Buildout Cost (SP007 Only)

| Scenario | Scope | Annual Cost |
|---|---|---:|
| **Lean** | minimal translation lane | **$40k–$80k** |
| **Typical** | active, multi-domain gating | **$100k–$180k** |
| **Premium** | heavy review + public transparency | **$220k–$400k** |

> **Rule of thumb:**  
> A credible SP007 operates at **~$120k–$180k/year**.

### X-D. Why This Matters
- Ungated translation creates systemic risk  
- Reversibility protects downstream domains  
- Clear rejection preserves institutional memory  
- Governance prevents accidental commitments
