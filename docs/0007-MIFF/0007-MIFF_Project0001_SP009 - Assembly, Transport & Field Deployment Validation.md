## R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)

Structures don’t live in labs.  
They get moved, lifted, dropped, bolted, unbolted, shipped, weathered, and judged.

SP009 exists to answer:

> **“Does this still work after the world touches it?”**

If **SP008 proved strength in controlled truth**,  
**SP009 proves survival in uncontrolled reality**. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

---

## Core Doctrine (MIFF Field Law)

- If it can’t be assembled safely, **it doesn’t ship**  
- If it can’t be transported intact, **it’s unfinished**  
- If it can’t be reassembled accurately, **it’s fragile**  
- If it degrades silently in the field, **it’s untrustworthy**  
- **Deployment is part of the design**

---

## Phase 0 — Deployment Philosophy & Constraints

### Pass-1 Anchors
- Assembly sequence doctrine defined *before geometry freezes*  
- Field tolerance allowances > shop tolerances  
- Transport envelope bounds (road / rail / sea / air)  
- Environmental assumptions (temp, moisture, grit, UV)  
- Human vs machine assembly boundaries explicit  

**Cost:** ~$2k–$12k  
**R&D Value:** Prevents designs that only work indoors.

---

## Phase 1 — Modularization & Interface Design

### Pass-1 Geometry Truth
- Modules must be liftable with **SP003 constraints**
- Interfaces must self-index within **±0.5–1.0 mm**
- No blind fasteners without alignment aids

### Systems
- Standardized connection interfaces  
- Alignment & indexing features  
- Tool-access-aware joints  
- Modular breakpoints for transport  
- Error-proof mating geometries  

**Cost:** ~$20k–$120k  
**R&D Value:** Good modules survive bad conditions.

---

## Phase 2 — Lifting, Rigging & Handling Validation

### Pass-1 Reality
- Most failures occur **between fabrication and installation**
- Dynamic amplification during lifts: **1.2–1.6×**
- CG drift during partial assemblies must be bounded

### Systems
- Crane lift-point design & certification  
- Forklift compatibility testing  
- Rigging hardware & slings  
- CG verification  
- Shock & swing simulations  

**Cost:** ~$25k–$180k  
**R&D Value:** Most failures happen while moving, not standing.

---

## Phase 3 — Transport Stress Testing

### Transport Physics (Pass-1)
- Road vibration: **1–20 Hz** dominant  
- Shock events: **5–20 g** (uncontrolled)  
- Tie-down preload relaxation over time

### Systems
- Vibration transport rigs  
- Drop & shock testing  
- Tie-down & restraint validation  
- Road / rail / sea profiles  
- Containerized shipping trials  

**Cost:** ~$40k–$300k  
**R&D Value:** Shipping is a hostile environment.

---

## Phase 4 — Field Assembly & Reassembly Trials

### Human Reality
- Reduced tool availability  
- Weather interference  
- Fatigue and time pressure

### Systems
- On-site mock deployments  
- Reduced-tool assembly tests  
- Time-to-assemble benchmarks  
- Error recovery drills  
- Repeatability scoring  

**Cost:** ~$15k–$100k  
**R&D Value:** Precision must survive human hands.

---

## Phase 5 — Environmental Exposure Validation

### Pass-1 Exposure Bounds
- Thermal cycling induces micro-movement  
- Moisture ingress accelerates fatigue  
- Dust and grit destroy interfaces quietly

### Systems
- Weather exposure testing  
- Thermal cycling  
- Moisture ingress tests  
- Dust, grit & contamination trials  
- UV & corrosion resistance  

**Cost:** ~$20k–$200k  
**R&D Value:** Nature is relentless and unscheduled.

---

## Phase 6 — Field Instrumentation & Monitoring

### Movement Leaves Evidence
- Shock, strain, and vibration must be logged in transit
- Field health checks required post-deployment

### Systems
- Transport-installed sensors  
- Shock & strain logging  
- Deployment-phase data capture  
- Post-deployment health checks  

**Cost:** ~$15k–$120k  
**R&D Value:** Movement leaves fingerprints — we read them.

---

## Phase 7 — Documentation & Field Manuals

### Pass-1 Scaling Doctrine
- Human-readable beats clever  
- Machine-readable beats ambiguity

### Systems
- Assembly manuals (clear, visual)  
- Machine-readable deployment specs  
- Tool lists & safety notes  
- Transport labeling standards  
- QR-linked documentation  

**Cost:** ~$5k–$40k  
**R&D Value:** If it can’t be explained, it can’t scale.

---

## Phase 8 — Failure Capture & Iteration Loop

### Closed-Loop Reality
- Field failures outrank lab success  
- Feedback must return to SP004–SP008

### Systems
- Field failure logging  
- Deployment incident reports  
- Design revision triggers  
- Lessons-learned archive  

**Cost:** ~$5k–$30k  
**R&D Value:** The loop must close where the structure lives.

---

## Phase-X — Instant Buildout @ Market Costs (Added)

### X-A. Assumptions
- Full field-validation capability live Day-1  
- Transport + reassembly testing for **large MIFF assemblies**
- Multi-modal transport (road / container / crane)
- No borrowed labs, no optimistic shortcuts

---

### X-B. Equipment & System Costs

| Category | Cost Range |
|------|-----------|
| Modular interface development | $80k – $250k |
| Rigging & handling validation | $120k – $400k |
| Transport stress testing | $150k – $500k |
| Field assembly trials | $80k – $250k |
| Environmental exposure testing | $120k – $400k |
| Field instrumentation & sensors | $100k – $300k |
| Documentation & manuals | $40k – $120k |

---

### X-C. Instant Buildout Total (SP009 Only)

| Scenario | Total |
|-------|-------|
| **Lean industrial** | **~$800k** |
| **Typical market** | **~$1.6M** |
| **Premium / global deployment** | **~$2.8M+** |

> **Rule of thumb:**  
> **$1.3–2.0M** buys a serious, world-aware deployment validation backbone.

---

### X-D. Why This Number Matters

- Field failures are reputational, not just technical  
- SP009 protects every upstream SP investment  
- Deployment realism prevents brittle designs  
- Logistics is part of engineering, not an afterthought

If it only works where you built it,  
**you didn’t really build it**.
