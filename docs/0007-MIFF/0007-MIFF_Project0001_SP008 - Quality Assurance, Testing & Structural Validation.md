## R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)

This SP exists to answer one question only:

> **“Does this hold when reality pushes back?”**

Not simulations.  
Not vibes.  
Forces. Cycles. Failure. Documentation.

If **SP007 taught machines how to move together**,  
**SP008 teaches us what survives movement**. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

---

## Core Doctrine (MIFF Non-Negotiables)

- Every structure must be **testable**  
- Every test must be **repeatable**  
- Every failure must be **captured**  
- No silent degradation  
- **Validation > speed**

---

## Phase 0 — Validation Philosophy & Load Doctrine

### Pass-1 Anchors
- Structural standards: civil / industrial / custom MIFF cases  
- Load cases: static, dynamic, shock, thermal  
- Safety factors:
  - Production baseline: **≥2.0**
  - R&D / unknown regimes: **3–5×**
- Destructive vs non-destructive decision rules  
- Acceptance & rejection thresholds defined *before* testing

**Cost:** ~$2k–$10k  
**R&D Value:** Defines what “strong enough” actually means.

---

## Phase 1 — Load Testing Infrastructure

### Pass-1 Load Reality
- Structural test loads up to **2–5× service load**
- Reaction frames must exceed **test load**, not match it
- Hydraulic systems require **controlled ramp rates**

### Systems
- High-tonnage hydraulic presses  
- Tensile & compression test rigs  
- Shear & torsion test systems  
- Anchored reaction frames  
- Portable & embedded load cells  

**Cost:** ~$150k–$1.2M+  
**R&D Value:** You don’t guess at strength — you measure it.

---

## Phase 2 — Fatigue & Lifecycle Testing

### Fatigue Truth
- Most failures are **cyclic**, not instantaneous  
- Damage accumulates logarithmically  
- Small overloads matter if repeated

### Systems
- Cyclic load testing machines  
- Long-duration fatigue rigs  
- Programmable stress profiles  
- Vibration endurance systems  

**Cost:** ~$80k–$600k  
**R&D Value:** Most failures don’t happen once — they accumulate.

---

## Phase 3 — Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE)

### Detection Bounds
- Crack detection thresholds must precede yield  
- Surface & subsurface methods required

### Systems
- Ultrasonic flaw detectors  
- Magnetic particle inspection  
- Dye penetrant systems  
- X-ray / radiographic access (owned or partnered)  
- Thermal imaging  

**Cost:** ~$40k–$350k  
**R&D Value:** See cracks before they become events.

---

## Phase 4 — Instrumentation & Data Capture

### Pass-1 Measurement Reality
- Strain must be measured, not inferred  
- Sampling rates must exceed excitation frequency  
- Environmental context always logged

### Systems
- Strain gauges  
- Displacement sensors  
- Accelerometers  
- High-speed DAQ systems  
- Temperature & humidity logging  

**Cost:** ~$25k–$180k  
**R&D Value:** If it’s not logged, it didn’t happen.

---

## Phase 5 — Structural Health Monitoring (SHM)

### Long-Term Truth
- Structures relax, creep, and drift  
- Health changes silently without monitoring

### Systems
- Embedded sensors in test articles  
- Long-term monitoring platforms  
- Drift & creep detection  
- Alert thresholds & dashboards  

**Cost:** ~$30k–$250k  
**R&D Value:** Strength changes over time — we watch it.

---

## Phase 6 — Failure Analysis & Forensics

### Failure Doctrine
- Failure is data, not embarrassment  
- Forensics must preserve sequence and cause

### Systems
- Sectioning tools  
- Metallurgical microscopes  
- Fracture analysis equipment  
- Photo/video documentation rigs  
- Failure classification frameworks  

**Cost:** ~$20k–$150k  
**R&D Value:** Failure teaches faster than success.

---

## Phase 7 — QA Protocols & Certification Pipeline

### Pass-1 Discipline
- No undocumented tests  
- Versioned reports only  
- Pass/fail tagging immutable

### Systems
- QA procedures & checklists  
- Test documentation templates  
- Versioned test reports  
- Traceability & archive systems  

**Cost:** ~$10k–$80k  
**R&D Value:** Trust is built on records, not claims.

---

## Phase 8 — Training & Safety Enforcement

- Operator certification  
- Defined test safety zones  
- Emergency response tooling  
- Clear escalation authority  

**Cost:** ~$10k–$60k  
**R&D Value:** Testing environments are dangerous by design.

---

## Phase-X — Instant Buildout @ Market Costs (Added)

### X-A. Assumptions
- Full MIFF QA lab live Day-1  
- Structural tests up to **multi-MN loads**
- Fatigue + NDE + SHM active
- No phasing, no borrowed infrastructure

---

### X-B. Equipment & System Costs

| Category | Cost Range |
|------|-----------|
| Load testing infrastructure | $400k – $1.5M |
| Fatigue & lifecycle rigs | $250k – $900k |
| NDE systems | $150k – $450k |
| Instrumentation & DAQ | $100k – $300k |
| Structural health monitoring | $120k – $350k |
| Failure analysis & forensics | $80k – $250k |
| QA systems & certification | $50k – $150k |

---

### X-C. Instant Buildout Total (SP008 Only)

| Scenario | Total |
|-------|-------|
| **Lean industrial** | **~$1.2M** |
| **Typical market** | **~$2.4M** |
| **Premium / dense metro** | **~$4.0M+** |

> **Rule of thumb:**  
> **$2–3M** buys a serious, truth-driven QA & validation backbone.

---

### X-D. Why This Number Matters

- Validation prevents catastrophic field failures  
- SP008 protects every upstream SP investment  
- Credible testing unlocks certification & trust  
- Data replaces argument

If it hasn’t been stressed,  
it hasn’t been understood.
