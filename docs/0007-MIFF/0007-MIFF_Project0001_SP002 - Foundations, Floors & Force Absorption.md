# MIFF · Project0001  
## SP002 — Foundations, Floors & Force Absorption

---

## R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)

MIFF doesn’t “sit” on the earth.  
**It interlocks with it.**

You don’t pour “a floor.”  
**You pour a map of forces.**

If the floor lies, everything above it lies.

SP002 exists to ensure that all forces introduced by MIFF die in the ground—  
never in precision, never in motion, never in memory.

---

## Core Principles

- Load paths are intentional
- Floors are machines, not surfaces
- Vibration is a contaminant
- Time is a force (creep, frost, settlement)

**R&D Value:**  
Truth begins underfoot.

---

## Phase 0 — Site & Soil Intelligence  
*(Know the ground before trusting it)*

### Scope
- Geotechnical surveys
- Soil stratification
- Groundwater and frost depth
- Seasonal variance modeling

### Doctrine
- **Geotechnical assumptions must be validated against worst-case seasonal conditions, not averages**
- Unknown soil behavior is treated as hostile
- Documentation survives construction

**Estimated R&D Cost:** $25k – $80k  

**R&D Value:**  
Bad assumptions crack slowly.

---

## Phase 1 — Foundation Strategy & Load Islands  
*(Separate what must not speak)*

### Scope
- Machine inertia blocks
- Isolated pads
- Structural separation logic

### Doctrine
- **No machine pad may share a continuous slab with a precision zone**
- Load islands terminate force locally
- Structural separation is physical, not symbolic

**Estimated R&D Cost:** $200k – $1.5M  

**R&D Value:**  
Shared slabs share lies.

---

## Phase 2 — Slab Typologies & Zoning  
*(Different work, different ground)*

### Scope
- HFZ inertia slabs
- IAZ precision-adjacent slabs
- MHS logistics floors

### Doctrine
- Slab design follows force class
- Flatness requirements declared per zone
- Repairs must preserve original intent

**Estimated R&D Cost:** $300k – $2M  

**R&D Value:**  
Uniform floors hide unequal forces.

---

## Phase 3 — Vibration Isolation & Absorption  
*(Silence is engineered)*

### Scope
- Isolation joints
- Damping pads
- Structural breaks

### Doctrine
- **Vibration acceptance thresholds must be defined numerically, not descriptively**
- Isolation performance measured post-install
- No assumed damping

**Estimated R&D Cost:** $75k – $400k  

**R&D Value:**  
Unmeasured vibration is fiction.

---

## Phase 4 — Flatness, Level & Alignment Truth  
*(Geometry over time)*

### Scope
- F-number flatness
- Levelness mapping
- Post-cure verification

### Doctrine
- Flatness verified after cure and under load
- Drift logged across time
- Resurfacing treated as structural change

**Estimated R&D Cost:** $50k – $200k  

**R&D Value:**  
Initial flatness is meaningless without memory.

---

## Phase 5 — Frost, Water & Longevity  
*(Time attacks quietly)*

### Scope
- Frost-protected foundations
- Drainage systems
- Vapor barriers

### Doctrine
- Frost uplift treated as dynamic load
- Water is managed before it arrives
- Longevity outranks speed

**Estimated R&D Cost:** $75k – $400k  

**R&D Value:**  
Water always wins eventually.

---

## Phase 6 — Anchoring, Preload & Torque Discipline  
*(Fasteners remember)*

### Scope
- Anchor design
- Preload specification
- Torque retention

### Doctrine
- **Anchor preload and torque retention are monitored lifecycle parameters**
- Loss of preload triggers inspection
- Anchors are not “set and forget”

**Estimated R&D Cost:** $50k – $200k  

**R&D Value:**  
Loose anchors lie quietly.

---

## Phase 7 — Maintenance, Repair & Expansion Readiness  
*(Future work without damage)*

### Scope
- Access planning
- Repair zones
- Expansion pour logic

### Doctrine
- **All expansion pour zones must be accessible without cutting active load paths**
- Repairs preserve original force intent
- Expansion never compromises calm

**Estimated R&D Cost:** $75k – $300k  

**R&D Value:**  
Good floors anticipate change.

---

## Phase 8 — Verification, Documentation & Ground Memory  
*(Proof survives time)*

### Scope
- Load documentation
- Vibration logs
- Flatness records

### Doctrine
- Measurements archived permanently
- Ground truth linked to facility memory
- Unknowns flagged loudly

**Estimated R&D Cost:** $25k – $150k  

**R&D Value:**  
If you don’t remember the ground, it will remind you.

---

## Phase X — Instant Foundation & Floor Capability via Market-Proven Civil Systems  
*(Reality before romantic concrete)*

> **Phase X exists to acknowledge that industrial-grade foundations already exist — and re-learning civil engineering through cracked slabs is expensive.**

Phase X provides a sanctioned path to **instant acquisition of proven civil, geotechnical, and slab systems** when doing so preserves load truth, vibration discipline, and long-term alignment better than bespoke experimentation.

Phase X is not a shortcut.  
Phase X is a **ground-truth doctrine**.

---

### Scope
- Geotechnical investigation & remediation
- Heavy equipment inertia foundations
- Precision flatness slab systems
- Vibration isolation joints & pads
- Frost-protected foundation systems
- Embedded utility raceways

---

### Doctrine
- **If a civil system has already survived decades of heavy industry, acquisition is preferred**
- Foundations must fail gradually, not catastrophically
- Serviceability without demolition is mandatory
- Black-box “standard slabs” without vibration modeling are prohibited

---
