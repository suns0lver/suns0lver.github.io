## Power Distribution, Utilities & Industrial Services  
*Feed the Beasts · Protect the Small*

## R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)

SP006 exists to **deliver massive utilities predictably, quietly, and safely**.

At macro scale:
- power surges travel  
- air lines vibrate  
- water leaks migrate  
- heat drifts  
- noise couples into structure  

If **SP005 held geometry**,  
**SP006 keeps it alive**. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Core Principles

- Utilities are **infrastructure**, not accessories  
- Dirty services are **isolated** from clean zones  
- Redundancy beats heroics  
- Maintenance access is **designed in**  
- Failures must **localize instantly**

---

## Phase 0 — Utility Load Mapping & Zoning

### Pass-1 Load Bounding
- Electrical: peak, surge, duty-cycle classified  
- Compressed air: steady vs impulse loads  
- Cooling: worst-case concurrent rejection  
- Water: process vs domestic separation  
- Gas & vacuum: bounded, monitored services only  

**Cost:** ~$3k–$15k  
**R&D Value:** Prevents undersized systems and dangerous retrofits.

---

## Phase 1 — Primary Electrical Distribution

### Pass-1 Electrical Reality
- MIFF-scale demand: **2–5 MW** typical  
- Large motors & lasers introduce **inrush + harmonics**  
- Precision zones require **isolated clean power**

### Systems
- High-capacity service entrance  
- Redundant transformers (where feasible)  
- Main distribution switchgear  
- Zoned subpanels (HFZ / IAZ / support)  
- Dedicated clean-power branches  

**Cost:** ~$150k–$1M+  
**R&D Value:** Power instability destroys machines quietly.

---

## Phase 2 — Grounding, Bonding & EMI Discipline

### Pass-1 Accuracy
- Ground impedance must remain stable across seasons  
- Structural steel becomes an antenna if unbonded  
- EMI migrates through utilities faster than air

### Systems
- Facility grounding grid  
- Isolated ground for precision zones  
- Bonding of structural steel  
- EMI containment strategy  
- Lightning & surge protection  

**Cost:** ~$25k–$200k  
**R&D Value:** Bad grounding corrupts everything upstream.

---

## Phase 3 — Compressed Air & Pneumatic Systems

### Air Quality Bounds
- Oil & moisture destroy valves and tools  
- Pressure drops induce process variation  
- Vibration propagates through rigid piping

### Systems
- Industrial compressors (quiet enclosure)  
- Dryers & filtration (oil-free where required)  
- Zoned pressure regulation  
- Ring-main distribution  
- Condensate management  

**Cost:** ~$80k–$500k  
**R&D Value:** Dirty air ruins tools and processes.

---

## Phase 4 — Cooling, Water & Thermal Services

### Thermal Reality
- Heat rejection scales faster than power input  
- Leaks migrate into foundations & precision zones  
- Freeze events are catastrophic if unplanned

### Systems
- Closed-loop cooling systems  
- Heat exchangers & chillers  
- Process water supply  
- Wastewater routing & treatment  
- Freeze protection & isolation valves  

**Cost:** ~$100k–$600k  
**R&D Value:** Heat is the silent efficiency killer.

---

## Phase 5 — Vacuum, Gas & Specialty Services (Bounded)

### Pass-1 Constraints
- Gas leaks propagate invisibly  
- Vacuum losses degrade process repeatability

### Systems
- Central vacuum systems  
- Local vacuum drops  
- Inert gas supply (as required)  
- Secure gas storage & monitoring  
- Leak detection systems  

**Cost:** ~$40k–$300k  
**R&D Value:** Leaks propagate faster than people react.

---

## Phase 6 — Noise, Vibration & Utility Isolation

### Isolation Targets
- −15 to −30 dB transmission into IAZ  
- Flexible connections on all rotating machinery  
- No rigid utility crossings into precision zones

### Systems
- Flexible utility connections  
- Acoustic isolation  
- Vibration dampers  
- Utility routing away from IAZ  
- Quiet corridors for precision work  

**Cost:** ~$20k–$150k  
**R&D Value:** Utilities shouldn’t announce themselves.

---

## Phase 7 — Control, Monitoring & Shutoff Authority

### Pass-1 Doctrine
- Detection precedes response  
- Isolation beats shutdown-everything panic

### Systems
- Utility monitoring dashboards  
- Flow, pressure & temperature sensors  
- Emergency shutoff stations  
- Zoned isolation valves  
- Alarm & alert systems  

**Cost:** ~$10k–$80k  
**R&D Value:** You can’t fix what you can’t see.

---

## Phase 8 — Maintenance, Safety & Lifecycle Planning

- Designed service access paths  
- Lockout / tagout integration  
- Spare capacity planning  
- Failure response procedures  
- Documentation & labeling standards  

**Cost:** ~$5k–$40k annually  
**R&D Value:** Utilities fail on weekends.

---

## Phase-X — Instant Buildout @ Market Costs (Added)

### X-A. Assumptions
- Full MIFF industrial backbone live Day-1  
- 2–5 MW electrical capacity  
- Zoned utilities for HFZ, IAZ, support  
- No phased installs, no optimistic reuse

---

### X-B. Equipment & Infrastructure Costs

| Category | Cost Range |
|------|-----------|
| Electrical service & switchgear | $400k – $1.2M |
| Grounding & EMI mitigation | $75k – $250k |
| Compressed air systems | $150k – $500k |
| Cooling & water systems | $250k – $800k |
| Vacuum & gas services | $80k – $350k |
| Noise & vibration isolation | $50k – $200k |
| Monitoring & controls | $40k – $120k |

---

### X-C. Instant Buildout Total (SP006 Only)

| Scenario | Total |
|-------|-------|
| **Lean industrial** | **~$1.1M** |
| **Typical market** | **~$1.9M** |
| **Premium / dense metro** | **~$3.2M** |

> **Rule of thumb:**  
> **$1.5–2.5M** buys a quiet, resilient, MIFF-grade utility backbone.

---

### X-D. Why This Number Matters

- Utilities dominate **hidden failure modes**
- SP006 protects SP003–SP005 investments
- Localized failure prevents cascading shutdowns
- Precision survives only with stable services

If utilities wander, precision suffers.  
If utilities fail, everything stops.
