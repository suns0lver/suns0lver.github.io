## R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)

Infrastructure isn’t finished when it’s built.  
It’s finished when it **knows how to age**.

SP010 answers the last, hardest questions:
- How do we keep this alive?
- How do we repair it without breaking trust?
- How do we retire it without leaving scars?

If **SP009 proved survival in the field**,  
**SP010 proves dignity across time**. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## MIFF Prime Law (Lifecycle)

- Everything **degrades**  
- Degradation must be **visible**  
- Maintenance must be possible **without heroics**  
- Repair must **preserve alignment**  
- Decommissioning must be **cleaner than abandonment**

---

## Phase 0 — Lifecycle Philosophy & Time Horizon

### Pass-1 Anchors
- Designed service lives: **10 / 25 / 50+ years**
- Subsystem-specific degradation expectations
- Planned obsolescence **explicitly rejected**
- Upgrade vs replace decision rules locked early

**Cost:** ~$2k–$10k  
**R&D Value:** Time becomes a design parameter, not a surprise.

---

## Phase 1 — Preventive Maintenance Doctrine

### Pass-1 Reality
- Wear concentrates at interfaces, seals, fasteners
- Alignment drifts faster than strength degrades

### Systems
- Scheduled inspection intervals  
- Wear-point identification  
- Lubrication, tension & alignment routines  
- Environmental upkeep standards  
- Human vs robotic maintenance boundaries  

**Cost:** ~$10k–$60k  
**R&D Value:** Most failures are preventable if named early.

---

## Phase 2 — Repairability & Modular Replacement

### Repair Geometry Truth
- Field repairs must avoid global disassembly
- Replacement must not disturb primary datums

### Systems
- Field-replaceable modules  
- Tool-minimized repair paths  
- Alignment-safe replacement procedures  
- Parts standardization across projects  
- Repair without full teardown  

**Cost:** ~$20k–$150k  
**R&D Value:** Repair is cheaper than rebuild — if planned.

---

## Phase 3 — Monitoring, Aging & Health Tracking

### Pass-1 Aging Reality
- Fatigue and creep accumulate invisibly
- Logs beat memory every time

### Systems
- Structural health sensors  
- Fatigue & creep monitoring  
- Drift & misalignment detection  
- Human + machine maintenance logs  
- Predictive failure models  

**Cost:** ~$25k–$200k  
**R&D Value:** We don’t guess when something is tired — we measure it.

---

## Phase 4 — Upgrade & Retrofit Pathways

### Evolution Doctrine
- Backward compatibility preferred
- Upgrades trigger re-validation, not hope

### Systems
- Retrofit-friendly interfaces  
- Load & force revalidation after upgrades  
- Documentation delta tracking  
- Versioned infrastructure states  

**Cost:** ~$15k–$120k  
**R&D Value:** Evolution without demolition.

---

## Phase 5 — Safety, Redundancy & End-of-Life Safeguards

### Pass-1 Endgame Reality
- Failure modes must degrade gracefully
- Shutdown must be calm, not catastrophic

### Systems
- Graceful failure modes  
- Load shedding & isolation  
- Lockout / tagout systems  
- Safe shutdown procedures  
- Human safety overrides  

**Cost:** ~$10k–$80k  
**R&D Value:** End-of-life should never be violent.

---

## Phase 6 — Decommissioning & Material Recovery

### Decommissioning Truth
- Teardown is a design phase, not an afterthought
- Recovery beats disposal

### Systems
- Controlled teardown procedures  
- Material separation strategies  
- Salvage & reuse plans  
- Recycling & return-to-earth methods  
- Environmental impact minimization  

**Cost:** ~$10k–$100k  
**R&D Value:** The cleanest structure leaves no ghost.

---

## Phase 7 — Knowledge Retention & Succession

### Time Outlives People
- Infrastructure must teach its successors

### Systems
- Maintenance manuals (plain language)  
- Machine-readable lifecycle specs  
- Training artifacts  
- Lessons-learned archives  
- Stewardship hand-off readiness  

**Cost:** ~$5k–$40k  
**R&D Value:** Knowledge compounds across generations.

---

## Phase 8 — Closure Review & Final Accounting

### Dignified Ending
- Lifecycle performance report  
- Failure & success audit  
- Environmental reconciliation  
- Historical record preservation  
- Formal retirement ceremony (intentional)

**Cost:** ~$2k–$15k  
**R&D Value:** Endings deserve dignity.

---

## Phase-X — Instant Buildout @ Market Costs (Added)

### X-A. Assumptions
- Full lifecycle discipline live Day-1
- Monitoring, maintenance, repair, and retirement funded
- No “we’ll fix it later” debt

---

### X-B. Systems & Infrastructure Costs

| Category | Cost Range |
|------|-----------|
| Preventive maintenance systems | $150k – $400k |
| Repairability tooling & fixtures | $200k – $600k |
| Health monitoring & analytics | $250k – $700k |
| Upgrade & retrofit tooling | $150k – $400k |
| Safety & end-of-life systems | $100k – $300k |
| Decommissioning & recovery | $150k – $500k |
| Knowledge retention & training | $80k – $200k |

---

### X-C. Instant Buildout Total (SP010 Only)

| Scenario | Total |
|-------|-------|
| **Lean industrial** | **~$1.2M** |
| **Typical market** | **~$2.1M** |
| **Premium / long-horizon stewardship** | **~$3.6M+** |

> **Rule of thumb:**  
> **$1.8–2.8M** buys a dignified, future-proof lifecycle backbone.

---

### X-D. Why This Number Matters

- Lifecycle costs dominate capex over decades  
- SP010 prevents silent decay and sudden collapse  
- Repairability preserves trust with operators and communities  
- Clean exits protect land, people, and legacy

Infrastructure is not immortal.  
But it can be **honorable**.
