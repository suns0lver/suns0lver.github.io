## R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)

SP007 exists to **multiply human capability without multiplying risk**.

At MIFF scale:
- robots amplify mistakes  
- automation hides drift  
- coordination failures cascade  
- humans must remain supervisors, not servos  

If **SP006 fed the systems**,  
**SP007 teaches them to move together**. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Core Principles

- Automation **assists humans** — never replaces judgment  
- Robots are strongest when **constrained**  
- Coordination beats speed  
- Every automated motion has a **safe halt**  
- Noise, vibration, and EMI remain **contained**

---

## Phase 0 — Automation Scope & Boundaries

### Pass-1 Truths
- Not all repeatable tasks are safe to automate  
- Failure recovery matters more than cycle time  
- Human authority must override software authority

### Scope Definition
- Automatable vs manual tasks  
- Payload, reach, precision envelopes  
- Human–robot interaction zones  
- Failure modes & recovery paths  
- “Kill authority” doctrine (single owner)

**Cost:** ~$3k–$15k  
**R&D Value:** Prevents over-automation and unsafe ambition.

## Phase 1 — Heavy Robotic Platforms

### Pass-1 Physics Bounds
- Typical payload classes: **150–1,000+ kg**
- Dynamic amplification during acceleration: **1.3–1.6× payload**
- Base anchoring must exceed **worst-case moment**, not static load

### Systems
- Industrial robotic arms (high payload)  
- Linear rails & tracks  
- Gantry robots for large envelopes  
- End-effector change systems  

**Cost:** ~$200k–$1.5M+  
**R&D Value:** Robots should move mass predictably, not impressively.

---

## Phase 2 — Assisted Fabrication Cells

### Cell Doctrine
- Cells isolate risk **before** automation scales it
- Humans remain inside the loop for judgment calls

### Systems
- Robot-assisted welding stations  
- Automated cutting / forming cells  
- Hybrid human–robot workstations  
- Enclosures with acoustic & spark containment  

**Cost:** ~$150k–$900k  
**R&D Value:** Cells isolate risk while increasing consistency.

---

## Phase 3 — Sensing, Vision & Awareness

### Pass-1 Accuracy
- Vision latency must be < motion response window  
- Force/torque sensing required for contact tasks  
- Redundant sensing preferred over “smarter” code

### Systems
- Machine vision systems  
- Force & torque sensors  
- Proximity & collision detection  
- Part presence & orientation sensing  

**Cost:** ~$50k–$400k  
**R&D Value:** Blind robots are liabilities.

---

## Phase 4 — Control Systems & Coordination Logic

### Coordination Reality
- Multi-robot systems fail **non-linearly**
- Determinism beats optimization

### Systems
- Central robot controllers  
- Deterministic motion planning  
- Inter-robot coordination rules  
- Integration with SP006 monitoring  

**Cost:** ~$40k–$300k  
**R&D Value:** Coordination prevents expensive choreography errors.

---

## Phase 5 — Human Safety & Collaboration

### Pass-1 Doctrine
- Humans must always outrank automation  
- Safe torque off > emergency stop spam

### Systems
- Light curtains & safety scanners  
- Speed-and-separation monitoring  
- Safe-torque-off systems  
- Clearly defined human zones  

**Cost:** ~$25k–$200k  
**R&D Value:** Humans must always outrank automation.

---

## Phase 6 — Noise, Vibration & Isolation

### Isolation Targets
- −15 to −30 dB transmission outside cells  
- Vibration isolation on all robot bases  
- EMI shielding near vision & control systems

### Systems
- Acoustic enclosures  
- Vibration-isolated robot bases  
- EMI shielding  
- Separation from IAZ  

**Cost:** ~$20k–$150k  
**R&D Value:** Robots shouldn’t announce themselves.

---

## Phase 7 — Programming, Simulation & Dry-Runs

### Pass-1 Truth
- Simulated crashes are cheaper than real ones  
- Edge cases dominate real-world failures

### Systems
- Offline programming tools  
- Digital twins for cells  
- Simulation of edge cases  
- Emergency stop drills  

**Cost:** ~$15k–$120k  
**R&D Value:** Simulate crashes before they’re real.

---

## Phase 8 — Maintenance, Calibration & Drift Control

- Scheduled recalibration  
- Wear tracking  
- Spare parts & tooling  
- Performance drift logs  

**Cost:** ~$10k–$80k annually  
**R&D Value:** Robots age too.

## Phase-X — Instant Buildout @ Market Costs (Added)

### X-A. Assumptions
- Multiple heavy robotic cells active Day-1  
- Payloads up to **1 t**
- Full sensing, safety, simulation, and containment
- No phased rollout, no experimental shortcuts

### X-B. Equipment & System Costs

| Category | Cost Range |
|------|-----------|
| Heavy robotic platforms | $500k – $2.0M |
| Assisted fabrication cells | $400k – $1.5M |
| Sensing & vision systems | $150k – $500k |
| Control & coordination | $100k – $400k |
| Human safety systems | $75k – $300k |
| Noise, vibration & EMI | $60k – $200k |
| Simulation & programming | $50k – $200k |

---

### X-C. Instant Buildout Total (SP007 Only)

| Scenario | Total |
|-------|-------|
| **Lean industrial** | **~$1.4M** |
| **Typical market** | **~$2.6M** |
| **Premium / dense metro** | **~$4.5M+** |

> **Rule of thumb:**  
> **$2–3.5M** buys a serious, human-respecting automation backbone.

---

### X-D. Why This Number Matters

- Automation failures scale faster than manual ones  
- SP007 protects humans **and** upstream SP004 investments  
- Coordination failures are expensive and public  
- Safe automation compounds capability instead of risk

Automation multiplies intent.  
Bad intent multiplies faster.
