## R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)

SP003 exists to move heavy things **predictably, repeatedly, and without surprise**.

At macro scale:
- momentum injures  
- improvisation kills  
- congestion creates accidents  
- shortcuts become incidents  

If **SP002 anchored the truth**,  
**SP003 moves it without breaking it**. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

---

## Core Principles

- Paths are designed **before** loads move  
- Lifting capacity **exceeds expected load** (always)  
- Redundancy beats heroics  
- Humans never become load paths  
- **Flow is safety**

---

## Phase 0 — Load Classes, Routes & Risk Map  
*(Before equipment selection)*

### Load Taxonomy (Pass-1 Bounding)

| Class | Mass Range | Typical Loads | Design Multiplier |
|-----|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| **L1 – Precision** | 50–500 kg | tooling heads, sub-modules | ×3.0 |
| **L2 – Structural** | 0.5–5 t | frames, housings | ×2.5 |
| **L3 – Core Mass** | 5–25 t | bases, dies, large fixtures | ×2.0 |

**Rigging allowance:** +10–15% mass  
**Design rule:**  
> Rated capacity ≥ (Max load × multiplier), *including rigging* :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

### Foundational Mapping
- Lift frequency & duty cycles  
- Horizontal vs vertical moves  
- Overhead vs floor-based transport  
- Human exposure mapping  

**Cost:** ~$2k–$8k  
**R&D Value:** Prevents impressive gear that doesn’t fit the work.

---

## Phase 1 — Overhead Lifting Systems (Primary)

### Bounding Requirement
- Max effective L3 load (incl. rigging): ~28 t  
- Required rating (×2.0): **≥56 t**

**Locked class:**  
> **60-ton double-girder bridge cranes** in core bays

### System Types
- Bridge cranes (single/double girder as required)  
- Gantry cranes for modular zones  
- Monorails for repeatable L1/L2 paths  
- Variable-speed hoists with soft start/stop  

### Doctrine
- Crane coverage overlaps; **no dead zones**  
- Rated capacity includes rigging  
- Controls prioritize **smoothness over speed**

**Cost:** ~$60k–$600k+  
**R&D Value:** Overhead lifting clears floors and stabilizes flow.

---

## Phase 1A — Dynamic Load & Momentum Control (Added)

### Vertical Stop Force Check
Using controlled hoist acceleration (~0.15 g):

- Controlled stop ≈ **280 kN**
- Hard stop (~0.5 g) ≈ **368 kN**
- **≈31% force spike avoided** via smooth control

**Rule:**  
> Machines absorb momentum so structures and humans don’t.

---

## Phase 2 — Rigging, Fixtures & Load Control

### Pass-1 Rigging Bounds
- Worst case: 4-leg sling @ 60°  
- Per-leg tension ≈ W / 2  
- Required safety factor: **≥5:1**

**Minimum per-leg WLL for L3:** **≥70 t**

### Components
- Rated slings, chains, spreader bars  
- Adjustable lifting fixtures  
- CG-finding & leveling devices  
- Shock-absorbing rigging elements  

**Cost:** ~$10k–$80k  
**R&D Value:** Bad rigging turns good cranes into hazards.

---

## Phase 3 — Floor-Based Transport & Short Moves

### Doctrine
- Forks are the **exception**, not the default  
- Floor paths are wide, marked, unobstructed  

### Pass-1 Reality Check
- Human push limit ≈ 250 N  
- Loads >5 t require **air casters or powered carts**  
- Forklifts introduce tip and braking impulse risk

### Tools
- Heavy-duty carts & dollies  
- Air casters for ultra-heavy moves  
- Forklifts only where unavoidable  
- Pallet systems interfacing with cranes  

**Cost:** ~$20k–$250k  
**R&D Value:** Most accidents happen close to the ground.

---

## Phase 4 — Precision Handling Near IAZ & MAM Interfaces

### Added Settling Protocol
- Oscillation decay target: **<2 mm**
- Typical settle time: **5–12 s**
- Mandatory pause-and-settle before release

### Systems
- Soft-start hoists near precision zones  
- Decoupled transfer stations  
- Alignment pins & docking features  

**Cost:** ~$10k–$100k  
**R&D Value:** Precision dies during handoff, not fabrication.

---

## Phase 5 — Traffic Management & Human Safety

### Rules
- One-way logistics corridors  
- Visual & audible crane alerts  
- Exclusion zones under loads  
- Lockout/tagout during maintenance  

**Cost:** ~$2k–$20k  
**R&D Value:** People must never guess where mass will go.

---

## Phase 6 — Control Systems, Interlocks & Monitoring

### Added Phase-X Logic
- Load sensors & overload protection  
- Travel limit switches  
- Anti-collision logic (≥2 cranes/bay)  
- Usage logging for maintenance planning  

**Anti-collision buffer:** ≥1.5 m stopping envelope

**Cost:** ~$5k–$50k  
**R&D Value:** Machines stop before humans need to.

---

## Phase 7 — Training, Certification & Drill Discipline

- Operator certification tracks  
- Rigging training  
- Emergency drills  
- Clear authority hierarchy during lifts  

**Cost:** ~$3k–$15k  
**R&D Value:** Calm crews make safe lifts.

---

## Phase 8 — Maintenance, Inspection & Lifecycle Care

- Scheduled inspections  
- Wear tracking on rigging  
- Hoist service plans  
- End-of-life criteria  

**Cost:** ~$2k–$20k annually  
**R&D Value:** Neglected lifting gear fails without warning.

---

## Phase-X — Instant Buildout @ Market Costs (Added)

This section answers one question only:

> *“If MIFF had to stand up SP003 **tomorrow**, at prevailing market rates, what does it actually cost?”*

No optimism.  
No founder discounts.  
No future robotics.  
Just **checkbook-open, schedule-now reality**.

---

### X-A. Instant Capacity Assumptions (Locked)

To remain consistent with Pass-1:

- Core lift class: **60 t double-girder bridge cranes**
- Structural headroom: **90 t steel paths**
- Mixed precision + heavy workflow
- Safety-first overlap coverage
- Fully compliant training & inspection regime

This represents a **minimum viable MIFF internal logistics backbone**, not an overbuild.

### X-B. Equipment Cost Envelope (Market)

| System | Qty (Typical) | Unit Cost (USD) | Subtotal |
|-----|----|-------------|----------|
| 60 t bridge crane (double girder, VFD hoist) | 2 | $350k–$600k | $700k–$1.2M |
| 10–20 t gantry cranes | 2–3 | $60k–$120k | $120k–$360k |
| Monorail + 2–5 t hoists | 3–5 | $15k–$40k | $45k–$200k |
| Rigging sets (L1–L3, 5:1) | — | — | $40k–$80k |
| Air casters & heavy carts | — | — | $40k–$120k |
| Control systems & interlocks | — | — | $25k–$75k |

**Equipment Subtotal:**  
> **~$970k – $2.0M**

---

### X-C. Installation, Commissioning & Steel Integration

Market reality:  
Installation ≈ **35–60% of equipment cost**

Includes:
- Runway alignment
- Electrical drops & VFD tuning
- Load testing
- Control commissioning
- Documentation handoff

| Category | Cost Range |
|-------|------------|
| Installation & commissioning | $350k–$900k |
| Structural steel reinforcement (SP003 share) | $250k–$700k |

**Integration Subtotal:**  
> **~$600k – $1.6M**

---

### X-D. Safety, Training & Compliance (Often Ignored)

| Item | Cost |
|----|-----|
| Operator certification (initial) | $5k–$10k |
| Rigging certification | $5k–$12k |
| Signage, markings, alerts | $3k–$8k |
| Initial inspection & load certs | $5k–$10k |

**Subtotal:**  
> **~$18k – $40k**

---

### X-E. Instant Buildout Total (SP003 Only)

| Scenario | Total Cost |
|--------|-----------|
| **Lean / Regional vendors** | **~$1.6M** |
| **Typical industrial market** | **~$2.3M** |
| **Dense / premium metro** | **~$3.6M** |

> **Rule of thumb:**  
> **$2–3M** buys a *serious*, safe, immediately operational SP003 backbone.

---

### X-F. Why This Number Matters

- It anchors **capital planning**
- It exposes **false optimism**
- It allows **phase-deferral strategies**
- It proves MIFF is not “theoretical heavy industry”

Most importantly:

> *If you can’t afford to move mass safely, you can’t afford to fabricate it.*

---

### X-G. Strategic Insight (Non-Numerical)

SP003 is one of the **highest ROI systems in MIFF**:
- Prevents injuries
- Prevents machine damage
- Prevents schedule collapse
- Preserves precision upstream

It never makes headlines —  
but it **quietly prevents disasters**.

Gravity respected.  
Flow preserved.
