## Structural Assembly, Fixturing & Large-Scale Alignment  
*Holding · Squaring · Trusting the Frame*

---

## R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)

SP005 exists to **lock large structures into truth — and keep them there**.

At macro scale:
- gravity cheats  
- heat lies  
- welds pull  
- time relaxes joints  

If **SP004 shaped material**,  
**SP005 decides whether it stays shaped**. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Core Principles

- Fixturing defines **geometry**, not force  
- Alignment **precedes** joining  
- Structures must be **square before strong**  
- Thermal reality is **planned, not denied**  
- Verification **outlives assembly**

---

## Phase 0 — Alignment Doctrine & Datum Strategy

### Pass-1 Accuracy Anchors
- Primary datums: global X/Y/Z + master planes  
- Secondary datums: sub-assemblies  
- Full tolerance stack modeling (worst-case)  
- Re-verification checkpoints after **every heat event**  
- Single alignment authority per assembly

**Cost:** ~$2k–$10k  
**R&D Value:** Prevents “looks straight to me” failures.

---

## Phase 1 — Large-Scale Fixturing Systems

### Pass-1 Bounding Reality
- Fixture tables must exceed **assembly mass**, not match it  
- Typical structural assemblies: **5–40 t**  
- Fixture deflection target: **<0.25 mm under load**

### Systems
- Modular steel fixturing tables (heavy duty)  
- Adjustable datum posts & rails  
- Reconfigurable fixture kits  
- Load-rated fine-adjustment clamps  

**Cost:** ~$50k–$300k  
**R&D Value:** Good fixtures replace brute force with certainty.

---

## Phase 2 — Measurement & Alignment at Scale

### Measurement Envelope
- Laser tracker range: **10–40 m**
- Angular accuracy target: **≤5 arc-sec**
- Thermal drift correction mandatory above **±2°C**

### Tools
- Laser trackers / total stations  
- Long-range straightedges & precision levels  
- Optical alignment systems  
- Thermal-aware measurement instruments  

**Cost:** ~$40k–$250k  
**R&D Value:** You can’t fix what you can’t measure.

---

## Phase 3 — Assembly Sequencing & Stress Management

### Pass-1 Truth
- Weld shrinkage: **0.5–2 mm per meter** (material dependent)
- Asymmetric joining guarantees distortion

### Doctrine
- Symmetric joining sequences  
- Controlled preload vs post-load decisions  
- Temporary bracing & hold-downs sized for **weld pull**, not weight  

**Cost:** ~$5k–$30k  
**R&D Value:** Sequence determines distortion.

---

## Phase 4 — Joining Methods (Macro Scale)

### Joining Forces (Pass-1)
- Weld heat input creates **localized plastic deformation**
- Bolted joints shift under preload if datums drift

### Systems
- MIG / TIG / SAW welding as required  
- Bolted joint strategies  
- Hybrid joining methods  
- Heat input monitoring & logging  

**Cost:** ~$80k–$500k+  
**R&D Value:** Joining locks mistakes if alignment isn’t right.

---

## Phase 5 — Thermal Control During Assembly

### Thermal Reality
- Steel expands ≈ **12 µm/m/°C**
- 10 m structure, 10°C delta → **1.2 mm growth**

### Controls
- Pre-heat & post-heat capability  
- Localized cooling  
- Thermal blankets & shields  
- Distortion modeling tools  

**Cost:** ~$10k–$80k  
**R&D Value:** Steel moves when heated — always.

---

## Phase 6 — Post-Assembly Verification & Correction

### Verification Doctrine
- Full re-survey after joining  
- Correction only while fixtures still exist  
- Alignment certification required before release

### Tools
- Full-assembly re-survey  
- Stress relief options  
- Controlled correction (pressing, shimming)  
- Alignment certification reports  

**Cost:** ~$10k–$100k  
**R&D Value:** Final verification prevents field failures.

---

## Phase 7 — Drift, Fatigue & Long-Term Alignment

### Pass-1 Insight
- Gravity creep + cyclic load = silent drift
- Drift must be **measured**, not argued

### Systems
- Embedded reference points  
- Periodic re-measurement plans  
- Load-induced drift monitoring  
- Maintenance realignment protocols  

**Cost:** ~$5k–$50k  
**R&D Value:** Big structures drift quietly.

---

## Phase 8 — Documentation, Jigs & Reuse

- Fixture drawings & reuse plans  
- Alignment record archive  
- “What pulled where” logs  
- Lessons-learned repository  

**Cost:** ~$2k–$15k  
**R&D Value:** Every big assembly teaches the next one.

---

## Phase-X — Instant Buildout @ Market Costs (Added)

### X-A. Assumptions
- Heavy structural assemblies up to **40 t**
- Full fixturing + metrology + thermal control
- No phased purchases
- No in-house shortcuts

---

### X-B. Equipment & System Costs

| Category | Cost Range |
|------|-----------|
| Modular fixturing tables & kits | $120k – $350k |
| Laser trackers / metrology | $120k – $300k |
| Alignment accessories | $40k – $120k |
| Welding & joining systems | $150k – $600k |
| Thermal control systems | $40k – $120k |
| Verification & correction tools | $40k – $150k |
| Documentation & calibration | $15k – $40k |

---

### X-C. Instant Buildout Total (SP005 Only)

| Scenario | Total |
|-------|-------|
| **Lean industrial** | **~$550k** |
| **Typical market** | **~$900k** |
| **Premium / metro** | **~$1.6M** |

> **Rule of thumb:**  
> **$0.8–1.2M** buys a serious, geometry-honest SP005 backbone.

---

### X-D. Why This Number Matters

- Prevents warped mega-assemblies  
- Protects SP004 investments  
- Reduces rework orders of magnitude  
- Converts alignment from “skill” to **system**

If it isn’t square, it isn’t done.  
If it can’t stay square, it isn’t designed.
