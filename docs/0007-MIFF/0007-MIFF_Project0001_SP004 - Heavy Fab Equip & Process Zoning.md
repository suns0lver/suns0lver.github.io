## R&D Framing (Non-Negotiable)

SP004 exists to **generate force and shape matter without exporting chaos**.

At MIFF scale:
- sparks travel  
- heat migrates  
- vibration spreads  
- dust contaminates  
- sound injures  

If **SP003 moves mass safely**,  
**SP004 shapes mass responsibly**. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Core Principles

- Processes are zoned **before machines are chosen**  
- Hot, loud, dirty stay **contained**  
- Precision-adjacent zones are **protected**  
- Every machine has an **exhaust, a drain, and a stop**  
- Fire, dust, fumes, vibration are **first-class design inputs**

---

## Canonical Process Zones (Locked)

### A) Subtractive Cutting Zone (SCZ) — *Material Removed*
- Large CNC vertical mills (heavy frame)
- Large CNC lathes (long bed)
- Waterjet cutting (thick material)
- Laser cutting (bounded power)
- Plasma cutting (structural)

**Isolation:** vibration · sparks · fumes · noise

---

### B) Forming & Deformation Zone (FDZ) — *Material Persuaded*
- Press brakes
- Hydraulic presses
- Tube / pipe bending
- Plate rolls
- Bounded forging presses

**Isolation:** shock · impulse loads · noise

---

### C) Additive / Hybrid Fabrication Zone (AHFZ) — *Material Grown*
- Large-format metal AM
- Large-format polymer/composite AM
- Hybrid CNC + AM platforms
- Post-print stress relief staging

**Isolation:** thermal · particulate · EMI

---

### D) Finishing & Post-Processing Zone (FPZ) — *Surfaces Made Honest*
- Grinding & sanding
- Deburring
- Heat treatment (bounded furnaces)
- Shot peening / conditioning

**Isolation:** dust · heat · residue

## Phase 0 — Process–Machine Fit Analysis

### Pass-1 Bounding Inputs
- Material families (steel, Al, Ti, composites)
- Max envelope: **up to 6–10 m parts**
- Mass per part: **up to 25 t (SP003-aligned)**
- Throughput vs tolerance tradeoffs
- Cross-zone contamination risks

**Cost:** ~$2k–$10k  
**R&D Value:** Prevents machines from fighting each other.

---

## Phase 1 — Primary Cutting Equipment (SCZ)

### Pass-1 Accuracy Bounds
- Large VMC frame mass: **20–40 t**
- Dynamic cutting forces: **10–100 kN**
- Waterjet pressure: **55–90 ksi**
- Plasma arc temps: **>20,000°C (localized)**

**Implication:**  
> SCZ must be **structurally isolated** from precision and AM zones.

**Cost:** ~$500k–$3M+  
**R&D Value:** Defines what MIFF can remove cleanly.

---

## Phase 2 — Forming & Press Systems (FDZ)

### Force Envelope (Pass-1)
- Press brakes: **300–1,000+ tons**
- Hydraulic presses: **1–10 MN**
- Shock loads propagate through slabs

**Doctrine:**  
> FDZ slabs and foundations **decoupled** from SCZ & AHFZ.

**Cost:** ~$300k–$2M  
**R&D Value:** Enables geometry without waste.

---

## Phase 3 — Additive & Hybrid Fabrication (AHFZ)

### Thermal & EMI Bounds
- Melt pools: **1,400–1,700°C**
- Controlled cooldown required to prevent warp
- EMI sensitive electronics nearby

**Rule:**  
> AM zones never share air or structure with grinding or plasma.

**Cost:** ~$400k–$3M+  
**R&D Value:** Creates shapes subtractive methods cannot.

---

## Phase 4 — Containment, Extraction & Environmental Control

### Pass-1 Containment Loads
- Dust systems sized for **worst-case concurrent machines**
- Spark arrest mandatory in SCZ & FPZ
- Acoustic reduction target: **−15 to −25 dB across zones**

**Cost:** ~$150k–$800k  
**R&D Value:** Containment protects everything else.

---

## Phase 5 — Power, Utilities & Support Systems

### Utility Bounding
- Electrical demand: **2–5 MW total**
- Cooling loops for presses, lasers, AM
- Gas handling (argon, nitrogen, etc.)
- Emergency stops per zone

**Cost:** ~$200k–$1M+  
**R&D Value:** Machines are useless without stable support.

---

## Phase 6 — Safety, Interlocks & Fire Doctrine

- Machine guarding & light curtains
- Zoned fire suppression (metal, electrical, AM-specific)
- Hot-work zoning enforcement
- Lockout / tagout systems
- Emergency response stations

**Cost:** ~$50k–$300k  
**R&D Value:** Safety incidents halt everything.

---

## Phase 7 — Calibration, Commissioning & Acceptance

### Pass-1 Reality
- Alignment drift is guaranteed without baseline mapping
- Thermal growth must be characterized
- First articles define truth

**Cost:** ~$25k–$150k  
**R&D Value:** A machine isn’t real until verified.

---

## Phase 8 — Maintenance, Wear & Lifecycle Planning

- Spare parts inventory
- Tool wear monitoring
- Service contracts
- Predictive sensors
- Decommissioning criteria

**Cost:** ~$10k–$100k annually  
**R&D Value:** Heavy machines fail slowly, then suddenly.

---

## Phase-X — Instant Buildout @ Market Costs (Added)

### X-A. Assumptions
- One full SCZ, FDZ, AHFZ, FPZ
- Industrial-grade machines (not R&D toys)
- Full containment + utilities + safety
- No discounts, no phasing

---

### X-B. Equipment Cost Envelope

| Category | Cost Range |
|------|-----------|
| Cutting equipment (SCZ) | $1.2M – $3.0M |
| Forming & presses (FDZ) | $700k – $2.0M |
| Additive / hybrid (AHFZ) | $800k – $3.5M |
| Finishing & post-process | $300k – $1.0M |
| Containment & extraction | $300k – $800k |
| Utilities & infrastructure | $400k – $1.2M |
| Safety & interlocks | $100k – $300k |
| Commissioning & validation | $75k – $200k |

---

### X-C. Instant Buildout Total (SP004 Only)

| Scenario | Total |
|-------|-------|
| **Lean industrial** | **~$4.0M** |
| **Typical market** | **~$6.5M** |
| **Premium / dense metro** | **~$10M+** |

> **Rule of thumb:**  
> **$5–8M** buys a serious, immediately operational SP004 backbone.

---

### X-D. Why This Number Matters

- Anchors MIFF capex reality
- Prevents under-zoning disasters
- Enables phase-deferral strategies
- Makes SP003 ↔ SP004 sequencing defensible

If sparks, heat, or dust escape their zone,  
**the design has failed**.
