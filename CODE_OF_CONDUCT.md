# Code of Conduct

## Our Approach

Suns0lver is built on structural constraints, not social enforcement. This document exists for edge cases where structure alone is insufficient.

## Core Expectations

### What We Value

- **Honesty** — Speak directly. Avoid manipulation.
- **Clarity** — Prefer explicit over clever.
- **Respect** — Disagree without disrespect.
- **Contribution** — Action over commentary.
- **Long-horizon thinking** — Consider consequences beyond immediate gratification.

### What We Don't Accept

- **Harassment** — Personal attacks, threats, or sustained targeting
- **Bad faith** — Intentional misrepresentation or sabotage
- **Extraction** — Attempting to monetize others' contributions without consent
- **Coercion** — Pressure tactics, guilt trips, or manipulation
- **Spam** — Low-effort noise that degrades signal

## Scope

This applies to:
- GitHub interactions (issues, PRs, discussions)
- Communication channels (if/when established)
- Events or meetings (if/when held)

## Enforcement

If someone violates these expectations:

1. **First:** Direct communication preferred. Most issues resolve with clarity.
2. **Then:** Temporary restriction if behavior continues.
3. **Finally:** Permanent removal if harm persists.

Decisions made by project maintainers. Appeals welcome via private channel.

## Special Cases

### Disagreement Is Not Harassment

You may:
- Critique ideas, designs, or implementations
- Propose alternatives
- Point out flaws or risks
- Advocate for different approaches

This is collaboration, not conflict.

### Intensity Is Not Hostility

Some contributors work with high energy, directness, or technical precision. This is fine as long as it:
- Focuses on the work
- Doesn't target individuals
- Remains honest and clear

### Failure Is Allowed

Contributors may:
- Propose ideas that don't work
- Submit code that needs revision
- Make mistakes

This is expected. Learning is iterative.

## Attribution

This conduct model is minimal by design. Suns0lver is not a social platform—it's an infrastructure project. The work is the focus.

If you need extensive social moderation, this may not be the right project for you.
